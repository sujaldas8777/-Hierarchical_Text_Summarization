         "Each year on July 28, we come together to recognize World Hepatitis Day, a global moment to raise awareness, celebrate progress, and renew our commitment to eliminating viral hepatitis. At NASTAD, we are proud to work alongside advocates, policymakers, and public health leaders to advance  equitable access for solutions to the hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV.)  \n\nThis year marks a major policy milestone in the United States: the Cure Hepatitis C Act of 2025,  a bipartisan effort introduced by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). The Cure Hepatitis C Act of 2025 offers a comprehensive strategy that includes expanding hepatitis C access to testing and treatment, strengthening public health infrastructure at the state and local levels, and implementing a cost-saving subscription model to purchase hepatitis C medications through registered pharmacies, correctional systems, and the Indian Health Services. The legislation  empowers community health centers, opioid treatment programs, and correctional facilities to integrate hepatitis C services and advance hepatitis B prevention and treatment efforts, including support for point-of-care testing and linkage to care. NASTAD played a key role in supporting the development of this legislation and continues to advocate for its passage to help ensure everyone with HCV has access to timely, life-saving care. \n\nReaffirming the Importance of the Hepatitis B Birth Dose \n\nAs we highlight our progress, it’s also crucial to reinforce the need to protect evidence-based prevention efforts, particularly the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine.  Recognized as one of the first anti-cancer vaccines, the HBV vaccine is part of the national immunization schedules in 190 countries, including the United States. However, the hepatitis B birth dose specifically is only included in 113 countries. Studies show that administering the first dose within 24 hours of birth, followed by at least two subsequent doses, is 90% effective in preventing perinatal transmission. The introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine in the childhood vaccination schedule in 1991 in the United States has been the primary driver of the substantial decrease in prevalence of hepatitis B among persons 6–19 years of age. Despite decades of safety data and the successful reduction of childhood hepatitis B in the U.S., the universal hepatitis B birth dose recommendation is under threat. Global research has shown that even in regions where public health infrastructure is burdened by substantial health system barriers such as sub-Saharan Africa1,2,3, southeast Asia, and western Pacific countries, the HBV birth dose vaccine significantly reduced the risk of vertical transmission. Reversing course and implementing a targeted hepatitis B vaccination program has beendemonstrated to be ineffective in countries such as Greenland, Brazil, and Angola. Inclusively, this approach  was shown to complicate guidelines and requires substantial efforts for selecting infants at risk in addition to stigmatizing pregnant people. Additionally, HBV prevention strategies that include interventions to prevent perinatal transmission are considered very cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6957 per quality-of-life-adjusted life year saved.  In the United States, jurisdictions such as Hawaii have decades of experience demonstrating the life impact of the hepatitis B birth dose. In 1992, Hawaii implemented routine infant hepatitis B vaccination and according to Perz, et al. the last reported case in a child aged <15 years in Hawaii occurred in 1996. Additionally, the hepatitis B vaccination prevents hepatitis D, a virus that requires the hepatitis B virus for its replication. Globally, hepatitis D affects  nearly 5% (an estimated 12 million) of people who have chronic HBV. On July 27, 2025, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified hepatitis D as carcinogenic to humans. According to Dr. Meg Doherty, incoming Director of Science for Health at the World Health Organization, “this reclassification marks a critical step in global efforts to raise awareness, improve screening, and expand access to new treatments for hepatitis D.”  \n\nLooking Ahead  \n\nWorld Hepatitis Day is a time to reflect, but more importantly,  to act. With the Cure Hepatitis C Act of 2025 and renewed attention to hepatitis B prevention such as immunization, let’s  build on this momentum with evidence-based policies, person-centered care and community-led action. As Dr. Michelle D. Fiscus, MD, FAAP, pediatrician and Chief Medical Officer from the Association of Immunization Managers states  “The recommendation to provide hepatitis B vaccination to every baby not only significantly reduces the chance of a baby contracting hepatitis B from a mom who may not have been tested or know she's infected, but also gives us a chance to eliminate hepatitis B disease in the U.S completely.” ",

         "The ACIP must uphold evidence-based immunization policies grounded in rigorous science to protect public health. Recent changes, including the replacement of 17 expert members with individuals lacking vaccinology expertise and ties to anti-vaccine advocacy, risk undermining this mission. The committee’s position on immunizations should prioritize peer-reviewed data, transparency, and expertise to ensure safe, effective vaccine recommendations.\n\nACIP should reaffirm its commitment to established vaccines like hepatitis B, MMRV, and COVID-19, which have proven safety and efficacy in preventing severe outcomes. For example, data from 2025 shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce hospitalization in children and pregnant women, yet unilateral removals of these recommendations threaten access. With measles cases surging (1,300+ in 2025), ACIP should maintain robust childhood immunization schedules and Vaccines for Children program eligibility to prevent outbreaks and ensure affordability.\n\nThe committee should reject non-evidence-based claims, such as thimerosal’s alleged harms, debunked by decades of research. Its position must align with GRADE analyses and input from medical societies like the AMA and IDSA, excluded from recent deliberations. Restoring open work groups and expert-led processes is critical to counter the \"irresponsible and dangerous\" shift critics, including former CDC directors, have warned against.\n\nACIP’s recommendations shape insurance coverage and public trust. A science-driven stance will prevent confusion, reduce costs, and protect vulnerable populations. I urge the committee to postpone the September 2025 meeting, reinstate qualified experts, and ensure all immunization policies reflect rigorous, transparent science to safeguard lives.",

Furthermore, if rumors are true that you’re considering banning these vaccines, you drive up costs for healthcare because immunocompromised will be forced to get prescriptions for PEMGARDA. Which is substantially more expensive than covid vaccines. At a time when hospitals are already reporting being full, restricting access to COVID vaccines is stupid. \n\nHepatitis B vaccine - this one is newer to me so I’m not sure I had it. But if you can prevent the development of liver cancer, why would you not do that? \n\nAh, yes, the MMR/MMR-V. Are you ready for the reality? These vaccines still don’t cause autism.

He has undermined expertise, the scientific method, and a legitimacy of our public health infrastructure. I noticed that the hepatitis B, Covid, RSV and MMR vaccinations are up for discussion at this meeting. I don’t even understand why hepatitis B and MMR are being discussed. These are well established vaccines that have prevented thousands and thousands of deaths and have a great safety profile. Anything to restrict access to these vaccines will cause harm to the health of our nation, particularly children. We have just experienced the largest measles outbreak in over 30 years. It was made worse by the lies promulgated by RFK Junior. Likewise, the attacks on the safety and efficacy of the Covid vaccine and mRNA technology in general are unwarranted and not supported by the evidence.

         "\nTo the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices- ACIP:\n\nMy name is Dr Beth Weitensteiner.  I am a family medicine physician and site medical director in Seattle, Washington.  I strongly urge the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to maintain the recommendation of a universal hepatitis B birth dose in the United States. As a global leader in childhood immunizations, America has a responsibility to uphold science-based policies that protect all infants, children, and adults from preventable diseases like hepatitis B. Universal birth dose vaccination is simple, safe, and highly effective, and it safeguards every baby, regardless of perceived risk or circumstance, and helps close gaps in a fragmented healthcare system.\nEarly administration of the hepatitis B vaccine is perhaps one of the most critical components of this immunization, as age has a direct correlation with the likelihood of developing a chronic infection. Approximately 90% of infants who are exposed to hepatitis B will develop a chronic infection, placing them at a significantly increased risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. In the U.S., before universal childhood vaccination was recommended, an estimated 18,000 children were infected with hepatitis B each year before age 10. Nearly half of these infections were transmitted from mother to child at birth. Many of the remaining 9,000 children had no known exposures to the virus. Now this number is down to almost zero1. As a nation, we cannot afford to go backwards.  \nHepatitis B is endemic to our patient population with most patients getting the disease from vertical transmission from their mother.  One of our patients, a young man 30 years of age, contracted the disease in this manner.   He did not receive childhood vaccines and his Hepatitis B led to Hepatocellular carcinoma.  He died last year in July and left an infant son and young wife.    Simply put the administration of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin and Hepatitis B vaccine at birth followed by two additional vaccines at 4 months and 6 months would have prevented this young man’s death. \n\nWe actively screen all patients for Hepatitis B and provide vaccines to those who qualify based on that screening.  The evidence surrounding the efficacy of the vaccine and prevention of contracting hepatitis based hepatocellular carcinoma is unparalleled.    \nIt is well-documented that the hepatitis B vaccine is extremely safe for newborns. More than four decades of research and surveillance conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shown that most side effects are mild and typical of vaccines, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever.2 Since its introduction in 1986, the vaccine has been administered over one billion times worldwide, providing millions of children with lifelong protection against this dangerous infection.\nMost countries support the universal birth dose and follow the World Health Organization’s (WHO) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to administer the hepatitis B vaccine to all infants within the first 24 hours of birth. Some have suggested that the U.S. should adopt a policy of vaccinating only babies born to infected mothers, as is done in other parts of the world.. Community organizations and health systems in the U.S. currently struggle to identify those living with the disease, which makes disease diagnosis and treatment tougher than disease prevention. The U.S. lacks the public health infrastructure to ensure that all at-risk babies receive the birth dose in a timely manner, making universal vaccination the safest and most effective approach.\nFurthermore, history shows that universal hepatitis B vaccination is the only reliable way to prevent transmission of hepatitis B. Since implementing the birth dose, the U.S. has prevented over 500,000 childhood infections, reduced infant hepatitis B cases by 95%, and prevented an estimated 90,100 childhood deaths.3 Up to 2.4 million people in the U.S. are currently living with hepatitis B, yet roughly 70% remain undiagnosed. This undetected population places babies and children at risk of accidental exposure to this cancer-causing virus.\nWe firmly believe that every parent has the right to make informed decisions for their children. However, those decisions must be guided by clear, objective, and scientifically rigorous recommendations. Eliminating the universal recommendation would create unnecessary barriers and confusion, limiting access to the vaccine and undermining parents’ ability to choose to protect their babies.\nTherefore, I urge the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and all relevant authorities to stand firmly behind science, prevention, and the continued protection of our youngest and most vulnerable citizens by maintaining the universal hepatitis B birth dose.\n\nDr Beth Weitensteiner, DO, FAWM, FAAFP\nInternational Community Health Services\n\n",

         "ICEB-2025-0001: A Counterproductive Policy Harmful to U.S. National Interests\n\nTo the Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI am writing to submit this substantive comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule to replace the \"duration of status\" (D/S) system with a fixed-term admission period for F-1 students. By replacing the stable and predictable D/S framework with a rigid system of fixed terms and burdensome extensions, this rule introduces profound uncertainty into the U.S. education system. The Rule Guarantees an Administrative Breakdown\n\nOperationally, this proposal is unworkable and will create a system-wide crisis at U.S. While the goal of enhancing program integrity is laudable, this proposal is a fundamentally flawed and disproportionate measure that will inflict severe, self-inflicted damage on U.S. economic competitiveness, scientific leadership, and administrative efficiency. It is a policy that runs directly counter to American interests. The Rule Will Cause Significant Harm to the U.S. Economy\n\nThe U.S. higher education system is a major American export and a powerful domestic economic engine. International students are not a burden; they are a vital economic asset. According to NAFSA's 2024 analysis, international students contribute nearly $44 billion to the U.S. economy and support over 378,000 U.S. jobs annually. Their tuition payments are crucial for the financial stability of our universities, providing revenue that subsidizes the cost of education for American students and supports local economies in all 50 states. It creates a \"brain drain\" in reverse, pushing top talent away from our shores and into the labs of our global competitors, thereby ceding America’s hard-won competitive edge. This could lead to anxiety over potential denials, especially during global uncertainties like pandemics or economic shifts. As a contributor to campus life and future U.S. workforce (via OPT), I believe this erodes America's edge in attracting global talent, contradicting goals of fostering international exchange. We strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this damaging proposal in its entirety and pursue more effective, targeted reforms that protect both our security and our prosperity. As a current F-1 visa holder and international student in the United States, I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) proposed rulemaking (DHS Docket No. Unnecessary and Overly Broad Solution to Perceived Problems: DHS cites national security and fraud concerns, but the existing D/S system, bolstered by SEVIS since post-9/11 reforms, already provides robust oversight through mandatory reporting by designated school officials (DSOs) on enrollment, address changes, and program completion.",
         "Unnecessary and Overly Broad Solution to Perceived Problems: DHS cites national security and fraud concerns, but the existing D/S system, bolstered by SEVIS since post-9/11 reforms, already provides robust oversight through mandatory reporting by designated school officials (DSOs) on enrollment, address changes, and program completion. ICEB-2025-0001: A Counterproductive Policy Harmful to U.S. National Interests\n\nTo the Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI am writing to submit this substantive comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule to replace the \"duration of status\" (D/S) system with a fixed-term admission period for F-1 students. ICEB–2025–0001, RIN 1653–AA95) \n\nIncreased Administrative and Financial Burdens on Students: The proposal requires F-1 students to file EOS applications with USCIS for stays beyond the initial fixed period (up to 4 years, tied to program length). Targeted enforcement (e.g., audits of high-risk cases) would be more effective than overhauling a system that has worked for decades, especially since the proposal's own economic analysis estimates annualized costs of $390-392 million, much of which falls on students and schools. This proposed rule is a high-pain, low-gain policy that sacrifices a major economic and intellectual asset for a marginal enforcement goal. A more effective strategy would focus on targeted enforcement:\n\nEnhance SEVP Oversight: Empower the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to conduct more frequent, data-driven audits of institutions that show signs of abuse. Universities, Economy, and Global Competitiveness: International students contribute billions to the U.S. economy through tuition, housing, and innovation (e.g., in STEM fields). The National Science Foundation reports that the median time to complete a doctorate in critical STEM fields is nearly six years, with humanities taking even longer. According to NAFSA's 2024 analysis, international students contribute nearly $44 billion to the U.S. economy and support over 378,000 U.S. jobs annually. It would shift the responsibility for hundreds of thousands of routine program extensions from highly efficient Designated School Officials (DSOs) at universities to an already-overburdened federal agency. These rigid rules could force students to abandon promising paths or rush through programs, harming educational quality and innovation, which contradicts the U.S.'s reputation as a hub for flexible, world-class education. Disruption to Academic Flexibility and Progress: Under the new rules, F-1 students would face restrictions on changing educational objectives, transferring schools without completing the first academic year, or pursuing programs at the same or lower educational levels. The world's most talented students will logically choose to study in competitor nations like Canada, the UK, and Australia, which are actively creating more welcoming immigration policies. Risk of Unintentional Overstays and Immigration Consequences: The proposal could inadvertently cause more overstays due to USCIS processing backlogs, leading to accrual of unlawful presence and bars to re-entry (under INA 212(a)(9)). This rule could deter prospective students by making the U.S. less attractive compared to countries like Canada or Australia, which offer more flexible visa systems. This rule, which seeks to replace the long-standing \"duration of status\" (D/S) framework with a fixed-term admission period, is a deeply flawed and counterproductive policy. This proposal, which seeks to replace the long-standing \"duration of status\" (D/S) framework with a fixed-term admission system for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, represents a significant and detrimental policy shift. Recommendations:\nInstead of this damaging proposal, I urge you to adopt a more effective approach:\nRetain Duration of Status (D/S): The most efficient solution is to maintain the existing framework and focus enforcement on a small number of non-compliant institutions, not penalize the entire student population. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule, \"Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.\" Devastating Economic Impact\n\nThe proposed rule will inevitably lead to a sharp decline in the number of international students choosing to study in the United States, triggering a severe negative economic shock. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule. Illogical Restrictions on Academic Progression and Interdisciplinary Study\n\nThe proposed restrictions on changing degree levels or pursuing subsequent degrees at the same level are arbitrary and ignore the realities of the modern economy. While I understand the stated goal of ensuring program compliance, this proposal is an overly broad and punitive measure that will cause significant, irreparable harm to the American economy, its world-class higher education system, and its administrative agencies. The rule would impose severe and unnecessary burdens on students, academic institutions, and government agencies, while simultaneously undermining the competitiveness of American higher education and scientific research. By forcing hundreds of thousands of students to file Form I-539 applications for an Extension of Stay (EOS) annually, the rule would bury USCIS in a mountain of new paperwork. The current population of over one million international students contributes tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy annually, supports hundreds of thousands of American jobs, drives economic growth through spending and innovation, and provides substantial tax revenue. The DHS's own regulatory impact analysis, as cited in the proposal, estimates the annualized social cost to be between $390 million and $392 million and anticipates over 400,000 new Extension of Stay (EOS) applications annually (90 FR 42074). While the proposed 240-day grace period for EOS applicants may seem adequate on paper, it is based on an optimistic view of current processing times. Triggering unlawful presence the day after an I-94 expires, with no grace period for a denied EOS, harshly penalizes students for minor administrative or postal delays that are often beyond their control. Instead of targeting the specific issue, it punishes the entire population of law-abiding international students, scholars, and exchange visitors. ICEB-2025-0001\n\nI firmly oppose the DHS proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” This regulation introduces unnecessary complexity into a system that is already effective, threatens U.S. leadership in education and research, and fails to achieve its intended security objectives. Fixed admission periods are unnecessary: The Duration of Status (D/S) model, supported by SEVIS, already provides DHS with real-time monitoring of enrollment, program changes, and compliance. Dear Sir/Madam:\n\nI write to respectfully oppose the proposed rule published on August 28, 2025, that seeks to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F-1 students and replace it with a fixed period of admission. For these reasons, I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposal in its current form and to work with higher education stakeholders on balanced alternatives that protect program integrity while preserving the flexibility and competitiveness that have long made the United States the top destination for international students. While I understand DHS’s intent to strengthen oversight, I believe this proposal will create far-reaching unintended consequences that would ultimately harm the United States’ economy, higher education system, and global competitiveness. I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and pursue evidence-driven, proportional measures that protect national security without undermining America’s role as a leader in global education and innovation. Replacing D/S with rigid admission dates and mandatory extension filings would overwhelm USCIS with predictable, low-risk applications, divert resources from higher-priority enforcement, and create uncertainty for students and schools. This would overwhelm USCIS with additional caseloads, exacerbate existing backlogs, and slow down adjudication for all categories of applications, not just student cases. Implement automatic status and work continuation for timely extension filings. Increased Administrative Burden and Inefficiency\nThe proposed change would force hundreds of thousands of students to file Form I-539 applications for extensions each year. Restrictions on Second Degrees and Program Changes Are Illogical\nThe proposed rule would limit students’ ability to pursue a second master’s degree, change their field of study, or switch degree levels. These changes risk pushing international students and researchers to competitor countries with simpler systems, harming U.S. universities, research labs, and economic growth. Given that the U.S. has long relied on STEM Ph.D. graduates to drive economic growth and technological leadership, this policy would be self-defeating. Misguided Approach to Addressing Abuse\nIf DHS’s concern is the misuse of programs such as “Day 1 CPT” to circumvent H-1B caps, there are more direct and effective ways to address that issue. Many programs rely on layered language instruction before degree study, and this policy would complicate legitimate progression. I write to respectfully oppose the proposed rule that would replace Duration of Status (D/S) for F- and J-visa holders with a fixed admission period, shorten post-completion grace periods, and categorically prohibit pursuit of additional lower-or-same-level degrees (e.g., a second master’s). I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and maintain the current duration-of-status (D/S) framework, which has successfully balanced national security, academic excellence, and economic contributions for decades. Limiting admission to a four-year period would force many students to file for extensions mid-program, creating uncertainty and jeopardizing long-term research projects.\nForcing extensions mid-program—and tying lawful presence or work to adjudication timelines—introduces risk to research milestones, grant deliverables, and collaborative projects, discouraging top global talent from choosing the U.S.\n\n3) Disruption to U.S. employers and the high-skill talent pipeline\nOPT and academic training complement American workforce needs, especially in critical fields. This policy change would deter international students from choosing U.S. institutions and drive top global talent toward countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, which have more supportive post-graduation policies. Global Competitiveness\n\nOther leading countries are expanding their pathways to attract and retain top talent:\na. Canada: Automatic 3-year work permits for Ph.D. graduates. 4) Increased administrative backlogs and misallocated resources\nRequiring large numbers of students and exchange visitors to file Extensions of Stay (EOS) will add substantial volume to already strained adjudicatory systems, slowing decisions for everyone—from families to businesses—without clear countervailing benefits to program integrity. ICEB–2025–0001), which would replace the current “duration of status” (D/S) framework with fixed admission periods for F-1 students, J-1 exchange visitors, and I media representatives. Conclusion\nThe proposal, as drafted, would erode the United States’ competitive edge in education, innovation, and the high-skill workforce; strain adjudicatory systems; and adversely affect local communities—without a commensurate integrity benefit. I respectfully urge the Department to withdraw or substantially revise the rule and adopt targeted, evidence-based measures that protect program integrity while preserving the openness and predictability that have long benefited U.S. society. While I appreciate the government’s responsibility to protect the integrity of the immigration system, these changes would impose broad, unintended harms on U.S. society. Negative Impact on U.S. Research and Graduate Education\n\nPh.D. and other research-based graduate programs in the United States often require five to seven years to complete, especially in STEM fields. If fixed periods are retained, align them with standard program lengths (e.g., Ph.D. norms) and provide an automatic, reliable bridge of status and work authorization until EOS decisions—so research, teaching, and internships are not disrupted. Making study in the United States less predictable and more bureaucratic will shrink these contributions and hurt thousands of small businesses in college towns. As a California resident who works in tech industry and closely follows U.S. immigration and higher education policy, I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would eliminate the current “Duration of Status” (D/S) model for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with a fixed admission period. By discouraging enrollment through rigid and uncertain visa rules, this proposal threatens billions in tuition revenue that supports U.S. academic programs, local economies around campuses where each international student spends an average of $35,000 annually on housing, food, and transportation, and tens of thousands of U.S. jobs linked to international student spending. I respectfully submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing a fixed admission period and extension process for F, J, and I nonimmigrant visa holders. In summary, the proposed rule would increase government inefficiency, harm higher education, threaten our ability to attract global STEM and AI talent, and create legal uncertainty for thousands of students and scholars who are already following the rules. Many highly qualified candidates may choose to pursue advanced degrees in Europe or China instead, where long-term research pathways are supported with less bureaucratic risk. Forcing hundreds of thousands of students and exchange visitors into additional applications will only exacerbate these delays, increase government spending on administrative tasks, and impose unnecessary uncertainty on individuals trying to comply with the law. This proposed rule imposes rigid constraints that do not reflect the realities of education, burdens lawful students and institutions with bureaucracy, undermines U.S. competitiveness, and risks billions in economic contributions. While the stated goal is to enhance compliance and oversight, the practical consequences of this rule would be significant, harmful, and counterproductive to the interests of students, U.S. institutions, and the nation at large. The proposed shift to fixed end dates provides minimal national security benefit while introducing significant costs and risks. This change introduces significant and unnecessary complexity, imposes major costs on both individuals and institutions, and ultimately risks harming the United States’ ability to remain competitive in higher education, scientific research, and emerging technologies. The long-term consequence will be a drain of talent, ideas, and innovation from the U.S., precisely the opposite of what our nation should be encouraging in a competitive global economy. That message will be heard clearly in Europe and China, where governments are actively investing in their research ecosystems and providing more accessible immigration paths to global talent. Misalignment with Academic Realities\nThe proposed 4-year maximum admission period does not align with the realities of U.S. higher education, particularly doctoral programs. Reduced Flexibility in Academic Growth\nThe rule restricts students' ability to pursue sequential or complementary degrees, or to pivot academic direction as interests evolve. In the long run, weakening our ability to attract and retain top AI researchers will directly damage America’s technological leadership. ICEB-2025-0001\n\nDear Officials,\n\nAs a faculty member at Arizona State University, I write with a deep sense of responsibility and concern to respectfully but firmly oppose the proposed rule that would replace the current “Duration of Status (D/S)” admission framework for F (academic students), J (exchange visitors), and I (foreign information media representatives) nonimmigrants with a fixed admission period and mandatory extensions of stay. U.S. universities—especially large public institutions like Arizona State University that host tens of thousands of international students—will face declining enrollments, reduced tuition revenue, and diminished global influence. The current \"duration of status\" system provides the stability and predictability that these high-achieving individuals need to succeed in rigorous academic programs. My position is not solely about the interests of universities or individual students; it is about protecting the long-term national interests of the United States—our competitiveness in higher education, our leadership in research and innovation, our economic vitality, and our standing in the world. Replacing D/S with fixed terms and frequent extension applications will make the U.S. far less attractive compared to competitor nations such as Canada, the UK, and Australia, which offer more predictable and stable visa policies. The Rule Will Undermine America’s Global Educational Competitiveness\n\nThe United States has long been the top destination for international students, attracting over 1.6 million in 2023 alone. While I appreciate the Department's stated goal of protecting national security and program integrity, this proposal is a profoundly misguided and counterproductive solution that will cause significant harm to America's higher education system, our economy, and our global standing. Competitor nations are actively expanding their international education programs, enhancing their global influence at our expense. The United States is the world's premier destination for higher education. Economic and Workforce Contributions Will Decline\n\nAccording to NAFSA, international students contributed over $40 billion to the U.S. economy in 2022, supporting hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Research and Innovation Will Be Disrupted\n\nInternational students and scholars are integral to America’s research ecosystem:\n\nIn STEM fields, international graduate students and postdocs make up a significant portion of the research workforce. U.S. Soft Power and International Relations Will Be Weakened\n\nInternational students and scholars often return home as lifelong ambassadors for American values, institutions, and culture. Adding layers of extension applications will strain USCIS resources and cause backlogs, without producing significant new security benefits. By replacing it with an arbitrary 4-year limit and forcing students into a costly and stressful \"Extension of Stay\" (EOS) process with U.S. Forcing researchers and students into cycles of visa renewals undermines the very continuity that large-scale scientific projects require. ICEB-2025-0001\n\nAs a faculty member deeply involved in teaching and research at a U.S. institution of higher education, I strongly oppose DHS’s proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” This proposal undermines the mission of U.S. universities, harms research and international collaboration, and fails to demonstrate any measurable security benefit. Recommendations:\nRather than imposing blanket fixed terms, DHS should:\n\t•\tRetain D/S, which balances compliance and academic needs;\n\t•\tEnhance SEVIS auditing and interagency data sharing;\n\t•\tIntroduce targeted enforcement for high-risk cases rather than burdening compliant students;\n\t•\tPreserve the 60-day F-1 grace period to facilitate lawful transitions;\n\t•\tEliminate nationality-based restrictions for I-visas;\n\t•\tMaintain academic mobility to uphold the U.S.’s role as a global education leader. I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the Duration of Status (D/S) framework with a fixed-term period of admission and prohibit students from pursuing programs at a lower or parallel academic level. Requiring every F and J visa holder to file extension-of-stay applications creates predictable, low-risk adjudications that will overwhelm USCIS and universities, diverting resources away from academic advising, compliance support, and security-focused oversight. The existing Duration of Status (D/S) model, combined with SEVIS reporting, allows for effective compliance oversight while providing predictability necessary for multi-year study and research. The existing D/S framework, paired with robust SEVIS oversight, strikes the correct balance between security and the flexibility needed to attract and retain global talent.\nReplacing D/S with a Fixed Duration Undermines U.S. Research and Competitiveness\n\nWhile the goal of maintaining program integrity is valid, the current SEVIS system already provides robust, real-time oversight of F-1 students. Replacing D/S with fixed admission dates and requiring mass extension filings will create barriers, discourage international enrollment, and push top talent to other countries with simpler visa systems. While intended to enhance program integrity, this rule is built on a flawed understanding of modern academia and the global competition for talent. Undermining U.S. Higher Education Leadership:\nU.S. universities are global leaders because they attract diverse, talented students and scholars. Beyond direct revenue, they enrich classrooms, bring global perspectives, and strengthen networks vital to U.S. foreign policy and innovation. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) with hundreds of thousands of extension applications from students who are in perfect academic standing. Conclusion:\nAs a professor, I witness firsthand the value international students, exchange visitors, and journalists bring to American classrooms, research, and society. Forcing every doctoral candidate to enter a state of uncertainty and navigate a burdensome extension process mid-research will disrupt critical, often federally-funded, projects in science, technology, and medicine. The United States’ strength in education and research depends on being a trusted destination for talent and ideas, not a source of unnecessary administrative barriers. I respectfully submit my opposition to the proposed rule (90 FR 42070 / RIN 1653-AA95) that would eliminate the \"duration of status\" (D/S) framework for F-1 students, J-1 exchange visitors, and I-visa holders and replace it with fixed admission periods requiring extensions through USCIS. While I understand the stated goal of enhancing program integrity and national security, the proposed changes to eliminate \"duration of status\" (D/S) in favor of a fixed period of admission for F, J, and I nonimmigrants are deeply misguided and will inflict severe, long-lasting damage on the U.S. economy, the operational capacity of our immigration system, and America's standing as a global leader in innovation and higher education. Negative Economic Impact and Reduced International Enrollment\nThe proposed rule will deter prospective international students and exchange visitors, leading to a significant decline in enrollment that will directly harm the U.S. economy. Other countries, such as Canada, the U.K., and Australia, are actively competing for international students by offering streamlined, multi-year visas with clear work pathways. Undermines U.S. Higher Education Competitiveness\n\nThe United States has long been the top destination for international students, largely due to its academic excellence and flexible immigration framework. The current D/S framework provides critical stability and predictability, assuring students that as long as they maintain their academic standing, they can complete their programs without navigating a complex and uncertain immigration bureaucracy. A Ph.D. student, for example, whose program often legitimately exceeds four years, would be forced to apply for an Extension of Stay (EOS) and face the possibility of denial or processing delays that could derail years of research. A brilliant researcher will think twice before committing to a multi-year project at a U.S. university if they face the risk of their stay being arbitrarily cut short by an EOS denial or a processing delay. Replacing D/S with fixed admission periods (up to 4 years) introduces rigidity where flexibility is essential:\n\nMany doctoral programs last 5–7 years, especially in STEM fields. If these talented individuals are pushed out, the U.S. will not only lose people it has already invested heavily in training, but American companies will also face a shortage of fresh talent and perspectives that directly fuel innovation and global competitiveness. Additional Bureaucratic Burden and Financial Costs\n\nUnder the current D/S system, students maintain compliance by following program rules and keeping SEVIS records current through their Designated School Official (DSO). Post-graduation training (OPT/STEM OPT): OPT eligibility could be jeopardized if extensions are delayed or denied, undermining one of the U.S.’s most attractive pathways for global talent. This will have incalculable negative consequences for America's economic dynamism and national security in the long run. For these reasons, I strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety and maintain the effective and proven \"duration of status\" system. Conclusion\nThe proposed rule is a fundamentally flawed policy that addresses perceived security risks with a blunt instrument that will cause widespread harm. I respectfully submit this comment as an individual international student and researcher in strong opposition to DHS’s proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) and replace it with fixed admission periods and a new extension-of-stay procedure. ⸻\n\nConclusion\n\nThis proposed rule threatens to disrupt academic programs, overwhelm USCIS, discriminate by nationality, and deter global talent—all without clear evidence of security gains. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that seeks to eliminate \"duration of status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with a fixed period of admission. While the stated goal is to improve compliance, this rule would instead impose unnecessary burdens on students, universities, and USCIS while undermining the United States’ global competitiveness in higher education. It imposes a rigid, one-size-fits-all framework on the dynamic world of academic research and global exchange, and it will ultimately undermine American competitiveness, economic vitality, and scientific leadership. ## The Rule Will Inflict Serious Economic Harm on Universities and Local Communities\nInternational students are a vital economic engine for the United States. ## The Proposal Creates Damaging Uncertainty and Will Erode America's Scientific Advantage\nThe proposal to limit admission to a four-year fixed term is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of advanced graduate studies, particularly PhD programs. While I understand the stated goals of enhancing national security and program integrity, I believe this proposal is misguided and will cause significant, irreparable harm to American science, our economy, and our ability to attract global talent. The duration of a PhD program is often determined by the complex and unpredictable nature of scientific discovery, including experimental setbacks, the need to explore new lines of inquiry, and unforeseen research challenges. For these reasons, I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the D/S framework for F, J, and I visa holders Withdraw the proposed rule and preserve duration of status for F, J, and I visa holders. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this harmful and counterproductive proposed rule. Discriminatory Impact\n\nThe proposal applies shorter admission periods to students from certain countries based on “overstay risk” or “reciprocity.” This unfairly penalizes individuals based solely on nationality, not conduct. They contribute billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy through tuition, housing, and daily living expenses, often paying higher out-of-state tuition rates that subsidize education for American students. Adding hundreds of thousands of new petitions will worsen backlogs, delay lawful cases, and push compliant students into legal uncertainty. he United States has long benefited from attracting international students, scholars, and exchange visitors, who contribute billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy, foster innovation, and strengthen cultural diplomacy. This undermines the United States’ global competitiveness in higher education and weakens its ability to attract top talent in STEM and research fields. Forcing hundreds of thousands of additional extension applications into the system will overwhelm resources, delay adjudications, and divert agency attention away from legitimate national security concerns. Replacing D/S with fixed admission periods will deter talented international students from choosing the U.S., especially when other countries (e.g., Canada, UK, Australia) provide more flexible and welcoming visa policies. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) proposed rule to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with fixed admission periods and extension requirements. However, under the proposed rule, this plan would be severely disrupted: Fixed admission periods and the restriction that F-1 students may only continue to higher-level studies would block me from pursuing my MBA after my first master’s degree. The proposed rule would force students and scholars to file multiple extensions of stay (EOS) throughout their academic program, creating significant cost and stress. Scholars and exchange visitors on long-term projects may see their work interrupted, reducing the effectiveness of U.S. research institutions and global collaborations. The proposed rule would force many students to leave the country mid-program to reapply and undergo lengthy consular processing, which can stretch into months. The rule is harmful, unrealistic, duplicative, and inconsistent with America’s long-term interests in education, research, and economic growth. Restricting this talent pipeline harms U.S. growth and future job creation, undermining America’s competitive edge. If they are forced to leave mid-program, the U.S. loses both the talent pipeline and the return on investment—while other countries benefit. A nearly identical fixed-time proposal was withdrawn in 2021 for lack of justification, and this new version suffers from the same flaw. DHS has cited national security as justification, but D/S combined with SEVIS already provides a robust oversight framework. This proposal was introduced in 2020 and subsequently withdrawn in 2021 after overwhelming public opposition. The proposed rule by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to impose fixed admission periods and extension procedures for nonimmigrant academic students, exchange visitors, and representatives of foreign information media would inflict substantial harm on the United States, undermining its economic strength, educational leadership, innovation ecosystem, and global competitiveness.\nThe proposed rule by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to impose fixed admission periods and extension procedures for nonimmigrant academic students, exchange visitors, and representatives of foreign information media would inflict substantial harm on the United States, undermining its economic strength, educational leadership, innovation ecosystem, and global competitiveness.

ICEB-2019-0006-000\nEstablishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students (F-1), Exchange Visitors (J-1), and Representatives of Foreign Information Media (I)\nDear Sir/Madam:\nOn behalf of The University of Toledo, I submit the following comments in strong opposition to the proposed rule published on September 25, 2025, which seeks to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F-1 students, J-1 exchange visitors, I media representatives, and their dependents. I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule that would eliminate \"duration of status\" (D/S) and instead impose a fixed time limit of admission for F, J, and I visa holders. Under the proposed rule, tens of thousands of international students and exchange visitors would need to file for extensions, each requiring forms, fees, and adjudication. Costly and Risk-Prone Extension of Stay Filings\nForcing students and dependents to file multiple extensions of stay with USCIS creates unnecessary financial strain—potentially thousands of dollars in additional fees—on top of tuition and living expenses. By imposing arbitrary admission limits and forcing reliance on a backlogged USCIS, the rule undermines U.S. higher education, deters global talent, and weakens our national interest. Fixed admission periods and the need for repeated extensions will deter talented students from choosing the U.S., pushing them toward countries like Canada, the UK, or Australia, which have more predictable visa systems. If changes are deemed necessary, DHS should instead strengthen current reporting systems and institutional accountability, without imposing costly, duplicative, and impractical requirements that undermine U.S. higher education. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead strengthen existing systems that already work effectively. By imposing a rigid cap, DHS disregards higher education norms, where completion timelines are typically calculated over five to six years. Arbitrary Four-Year Limit on Admission\nMany degree programs in the U.S.—particularly in STEM fields and doctoral studies—routinely extend beyond four years. This directly undermines U.S. workforce development, especially in STEM fields where international graduates are vital. The fixed time period undermines the nature of academic study. This policy is unnecessary, counterproductive, and damaging to the interests of the United States in higher education, research, and global competitiveness. It introduces unnecessary burdens, undermines academic realities, and diminishes the United States’ competitiveness in attracting international students and scholars. The current D/S framework already balances oversight with flexibility, ensuring that international students and scholars remain in compliance while pursuing educational goals. •\tGovernment Inefficiency: USCIS will be inundated with hundreds of thousands of new EOS applications annually, inevitably worsening existing backlogs and delaying adjudications for all immigration benefits. While aimed at enhancing security, this rule is an overly broad and counterproductive measure that will harm U.S. academic and economic interests, create immense hardship for law-abiding individuals, and impose staggering costs on all stakeholders. Unnecessary and Excessive Burdens\nThe proposed rule would create a massive new bureaucracy with crippling financial and administrative costs. By conflating isolated cases of abuse with the entire student population, DHS risks undermining America’s long-standing reputation as the premier global destination for higher education. This proposal would replace a functional, long-standing system with a rigid, fixed-term admission period requiring burdensome Extension of Stay (EOS) applications. While the stated intent is to improve oversight, this policy would cause severe economic harm, overwhelm administrative systems, and undermine the U.S. higher education system’s global competitiveness. I write to strongly oppose the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to replace “duration of status” with a fixed-time admission period for F, J, and I visa holders. •\tCreating Uncertainty: A simple USCIS processing delay could cause a student to fall out of status through no fault of their own, forcing them to cease studies, lose vital on-campus employment, and potentially depart the country.\nICEB-2025-0001, RIN 1653-AA95\nI write to express my strong opposition to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that seeks to eliminate the \"duration of status\" (D/S) framework for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Misguided Policy Targeting\n\nWhile the proposal cites abuses such as “Day-1 CPT,” this approach punishes the entire international student community rather than addressing specific compliance issues. The chosen 240-day extension window appears arbitrary and insufficient in the face of USCIS processing delays that already extend beyond eight months in many cases. The rule’s own provision for a 240-day automatic work authorization extension while an EOS is pending is a clear admission that the agency anticipates severe and disruptive delays. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety and instead focus on using existing tools like SEVIS for targeted enforcement against actual threats. Rather than leveraging this powerful existing tool for targeted enforcement, the rule creates a duplicative and far more cumbersome system of oversight. Targeted enforcement of violators instead of sweeping restrictions. Dear Officer,\n\nI write in strong opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (ICEB-2025-0001). I urge DHS/ICE to withdraw this proposal and preserve the existing “Duration of Status” framework, which supports both compliance and the flexibility required for higher education and international exchange. Comment on Proposed DHS Regulation Limiting Duration of Stay for F and J Visa Holders\n\nI respectfully oppose the proposed Department of Homeland Security regulation that would restrict the duration of stay for international students and exchange visitors to 2–4 years. To the Department of Homeland Security, Docket Clerk\nDocket ID: ICEB-2025-0001\nI am an international student currently studying at Johns Hopkins University in Biomedical Engineering. 2) Damage to U.S. Higher Education\n\nU.S. universities, including Johns Hopkins’ Whiting School of Engineering, depend on international students to sustain advanced research, teaching capacity, and vibrant academic communities. The proposed rule would disrupt this balance, creating unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, undermining academic progress, and discouraging the very international engagement that strengthens our universities and communities. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead pursue targeted measures that address program misuse while preserving the openness, flexibility, and competitiveness of U.S. higher education. While framed as a matter of administrative efficiency and national security, this rule would create significant negative consequences for U.S. higher education, research, and the broader economy. Negative Economic and Community Impact\n\nInternational students contribute over $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support more than 300,000 American jobs. 4) Administrative Burden Without Clear Security Gain\n\nD/S already pairs enrollment-based compliance (SEVIS reporting, full-time status, school oversight) with existing vetting. 5) Practical Alternatives\n\nIf DHS seeks better oversight, there are targeted, lower-burden options that preserve stability while improving accountability:\n\nMaintain D/S and enhance risk-based monitoring using existing SEVIS data rather than imposing blanket term caps. Administrative and Legal Uncertainty\n\nUniversities already maintain strict compliance oversight through SEVIS, which provides DHS with real-time data. Increased Administrative Burden\nRequiring hundreds of thousands of F-1 and J-1 visa holders to file extensions of stay (EOS) will overwhelm an already overburdened USCIS. Conclusion\nThis regulation will harm U.S. economic interests, overwhelm immigration agencies, deter top international talent, and impose unreasonable restrictions on academic and professional growth. Current I-539 processing times often exceed six months; adding hundreds of thousands of additional cases will exacerbate backlogs across all immigration categories, delaying decisions for families, workers, and employers. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cites concerns about administrative efficiency and national security, this proposal is a flawed, counterproductive, and overly broad solution that will cause significant harm to the U.S. economy, academic institutions, and global competitiveness. I urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this proposed rule and consider more precise, targeted solutions to address its stated concerns. I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and retain the proven D/S framework, while enhancing targeted oversight mechanisms to address fraud and security concerns. The Rule Will Harm U.S. National Interests\n\nEconomic Damage: International students contribute tens of billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy through tuition, research, and local spending. My primary objections are as follows:\n\nSignificant Economic Harm to the United States: The proposal's own analysis acknowledges that it will impose hundreds of millions of dollars in costs annually on all parties, including U.S. academic institutions and employers. The U.S. currently hosts over 1 million international students who contribute billions of dollars to the economy, support thousands of jobs, and subsidize tuition for domestic students. By requiring hundreds of thousands of F, J, and I nonimmigrants to file for extensions of stay annually, this rule will overwhelm USCIS, leading to greater backlogs, processing delays, and uncertainty for applicants. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule change from “duration of status” (D/S) to a fixed-term admission for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. A Broad and Ineffective Solution to a Narrow Problem: The proposal cites abuse of the student visa system, such as \"Day 1 CPT\" or \"pay-to-stay\" schools, as justification for this sweeping change. This policy will inevitably lead to a decline in international student enrollment, causing severe economic repercussions for universities and local communities that depend on their contributions. This rule will reduce enrollment, harming universities, small businesses, and entire communities that depend on international student presence. The proposed 240-day grace period is a tenuous solution, as severe application backlogs could easily cause a student's status to lapse through no fault of their own. It risks:\n\nWeakening the U.S. economy and universities,\n\nShrinking the skilled workforce,\n\nSlowing innovation and research,\n\nEroding U.S. diplomatic influence, and\n\nStrengthening global competitors at America’s expense. It undermines the very goals of administrative efficiency and global competitiveness it purports to support. Instead of reducing abuse, the rule risks creating perverse incentives: some students may feel compelled to leave mid-program or seek unauthorized work if they fear denial or delays. I strongly oppose the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students” published by the Department of Homeland Security on August 28, 2025. I write to strongly oppose the proposed rule ICEB-2025-0001 (“Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media”). Administrative Overload and Risk of Backlogs\nDHS itself estimates that the new system will generate over 400,000 additional extension applications each year. According to NAFSA (Association of International Educators), international students contributed more than $40 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2023–2024 academic year and supported over 400,000 U.S. jobs. Economic Harm to the U.S.\nInternational students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy in 2023–2024 and supported nearly 378,000 jobs nationwide (NAFSA, 2024). It will create unnecessary complexity, deter global talent, and diminish the competitiveness of the United States in the international education arena. The proposed change to replace the long-standing “duration of status (D/S)” system with fixed admission periods would create significant harm to international students, U.S. higher education institutions, and the U.S. economy as a whole. That reputation is built not only on the quality of American education but also on the relative flexibility and stability of its immigration policies, such as “duration of status.” The proposed rule threatens to erode these advantages, to the detriment of students, institutions, and the nation’s broader economic and research interests. Each seven international students enrolled in U.S. institutions create or support three American jobs across multiple sectors, including higher education, housing, transportation, healthcare, and dining. This measure is counterproductive for several reasons:\n•\tLegitimate academic pathways: Many students pursue a second master’s in a complementary field (e.g., public health + data science, or nutrition + biostatistics) to meet evolving workforce demands. Forcing them abroad for a second degree means the benefit of their expertise goes to competitor nations rather than to U.S. labs and industries. The “Second Degree Ban” Is Especially Harmful\nPerhaps the most troubling provision is the ban on pursuing a second degree at the same or lower level (e.g., a second master’s degree). Data from the National Science Foundation shows that more than 50% of doctoral students in engineering, mathematics, and computer science in the United States are international students. While I appreciate DHS’s stated goals of ensuring compliance, the rule as written will undermine U.S. national interests in education, research, and workforce development. It signals that the U.S. values compliance more than innovation, which runs directly counter to national interests. I strongly urge DHS and USCIS to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety and maintain the existing D/S system, which promotes academic continuity, reduces administrative burden, strengthens U.S. competitiveness, and upholds America’s longstanding reputation as a leader in global education and research. For all of these reasons, I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and retain the D/S policy. America has long benefited from its ability to attract and retain global talent.\nI am writing to express my strong and unequivocal opposition to the proposed rule published on August 28, 2025 that seeks to eliminate the long-standing “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with fixed admission periods and a burdensome USCIS-controlled extension process. By capping admission periods at four years and requiring students to file for extensions through USCIS, the rule introduces unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles that threaten the ability of students and researchers to complete their programs on time. Filing multiple extension applications will impose hundreds or even thousands of dollars in additional fees and legal costs, on top of the already substantial expenses for tuition, insurance, and living costs. However, I strongly oppose the proposed rule because it would have severe unintended consequences for international students—particularly those in STEM fields—as well as for U.S. higher education, research, and national competitiveness. According to the National Science Foundation’s Survey of Earned Doctorates (2023), the median time to complete a Ph.D. in the United States is 5.8 years across all fields, and even longer in engineering and social sciences. According to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP, 2023), more than 50% of U.S. billion-dollar startups were founded by immigrants, many of whom first came to the United States as international students. International students contribute billions of dollars annually through tuition and living expenses, and support hundreds of thousands of American jobs. This proposal would severely harm international students, researchers, exchange visitors, foreign media professionals, and the U.S. education and research ecosystem. Additionally, NAFSA: Association of International Educators reported that international students contributed $40.1 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 368,000 American jobs in the 2023–2024 academic year. Fifth, replacing D/S with fixed I-94 expiration dates would expose students and researchers to unintended unlawful presence penalties under INA §212(a)(9)(B). These additional legal and emotional pressures are likely to drive talented researchers away from the U.S., disrupting their work and undermining the academic communities that depend on them. By making immigration processes more restrictive and unpredictable, this rule would drive talented students and researchers to competing countries like Canada, the U.K., and Australia, which have adopted far more welcoming policies. Dear Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI am writing as a current PhD student in the United States on an F-1 visa to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) admission with a fixed time period of stay for F, J, and I visa holders. I am writing to respectfully submit my comment regarding the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” for F-1 students and replace it with a fixed admission period of stay. Imposing rigid fixed-time restrictions, coupled with reduced grace periods and program change limitations, will deter talented students from choosing the U.S. and push them toward other countries with more supportive visa policies. Administrative and Financial Burden\n\nForcing students to apply for extensions through USCIS instead of coordinating with Designated School Officials (DSOs) introduces unnecessary costs, delays, and risks of status lapses. Increased Administrative Burden Without Real Benefits\n\nUnder the current D/S framework, students and scholars can focus on their research and education without unnecessary immigration paperwork. Increased Administrative and Financial Burden\nThe rule would require USCIS and DHS to process thousands of additional extension applications annually. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and preserve D/S for F-1 students, or at minimum, provide longer admission periods, maintain flexibility for program changes, and implement safeguards against processing delays. For the sake of America’s long-term prosperity and global leadership, I strongly urge DHS to withdraw the proposed rule and continue the proven D/S system that has served the nation for decades. Conclusion\n\nFor these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and retain the current D/S framework. Arbitrary limits and additional administrative barriers will discourage talented students from choosing the U.S., diverting them to Canada, the U.K., or Australia—countries that actively promote long-term, stable study and work options. Such uncertainty will make U.S. universities less attractive to top global talent compared to countries like Canada, the UK, or Australia, which provide clearer pathways for long-term academic study. Academic Flexibility and Program Length\n\nThe assumption that every student can complete their program within a fixed number of years does not reflect the reality of higher education or other approved study programs. Chilling Effect on International Students and Research\n\nThe rule will likely deter highly qualified international students from choosing the United States for graduate study, especially in STEM. Impact on U.S. Competitiveness\n\nThe United States has long been a premier destination for international students, who contribute significantly to research, innovation, and the economy. International students contribute not only tuition and economic value but also vital research in areas like AI, medicine, and physics that directly advance U.S. national interests. According to NAFSA (Association of International Educators), international students and their families contributed $40.1 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 368,000 jobs in the 2022–2023 academic year. The Association of International Educators (NAFSA, 2023) recorded that almost 368,000 American jobs were supported and $40.1 billion was contributed by international students in the year 2022-2023. Data shows that underrepresented student populations in higher education are more likely to pursue non-traditional paths of study that require flexibility (Institute of International Education, Open Doors Report 2023). Negative Impact on U.S. Competitiveness\n\nOther countries are actively strengthening their ability to attract global talent:\n\nCanada offers international students multi-year study permits tied to program length, and post-graduation work permits without added uncertainty. Create unnecessary uncertainty for students whose programs extend beyond random admission dates because of factors outside their control, like research delays, illness, or program needs. Unfairness: \nUnderrepresented students or those from developing countries may need to change fields if their original degree does not match the changing needs of the U.S. labor market. Recommendation\n\nFor these reasons, I urge DHS to withdraw the proposed rule and maintain the current Duration of Status framework. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule completely and to avoid interfering with the current Duration of Status (D/S) system. Harm to Academic and Research Continuity\n\nThe proposed rule would impose arbitrary visa expiration dates, creating uncertainty that disrupts academic planning. Unreasonable Limitations on Pursuing Same-Level Degrees\nThis new rule states that if the student intends to pursue an additional degree at the same level of studies-before applying for an extension of stay-the student cannot go the extension way; for example, getting the second bachelor's or master's degree. Graduate and doctoral research often spans multiple years, and projects in STEM fields (Computer Science, Engineering, Data Science, etc.) Authentic Academic ways: \nMany students seek additional degrees to broaden their knowledge, like a second master's in data science after obtaining one in engineering. Eliminating it would create unnecessary uncertainty, reduce the attractiveness of U.S. institutions, and harm the long-term national interest. Existing Oversight is Already Effective\n\nThe SEVIS system requires schools to report student enrollment status, and U.S. consulates and USCIS have extensive authority to enforce compliance. I am now applying the skills and knowledge I gained in U.S. universities to my full-time work, directly contributing to America’s technology industry and economy. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed regulatory changes that would eliminate the current \"duration of status\" (D/S) framework for F-1 student and J-1 exchange visitor visas, replacing it with fixed-term admission periods requiring periodic extensions through Form I-539. Conclusion\n\nEliminating Duration-of-Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 visa holders would inflict strategic, administrative, and moral costs, undermining national economic interests and global leadership. Executive Summary\n\nI write in strong opposition to the proposed elimination of Duration-of-Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. I firmly believe that abolishing D/S in favor of rigid, fixed admission periods—capped at the program end date or four years, whichever is shorter—would unnecessarily undermine U.S. national security and economic interests, burden DHS and USCIS with avoidable administrative overhead, and erode the United States’ position as a preeminent global destination for talent and innovation. With Form I-539 filing fees at $470, plus potential additional costs for legal assistance or premium processing that can exceed $1,965, students face total expenses of $800 or more for each extension application. Re: Public Comment on Proposed Rulemaking: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students (F-1), Exchange Visitors (J-1), and Representatives of Foreign Information Media (I)\n\nDate of Comment Submission: [9/7/2025]\n\n⸻\n\nI. Enhanced monitoring protocols or focused reviews of high-risk cases would address security concerns without disrupting the educational experience of hundreds of thousands of legitimate students. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead pursue targeted improvements such as enhanced SEVIS monitoring or focused reviews for high-risk cases. The current SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) already provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities, tracking student enrollment, academic progress, and compliance status in real-time. Curtailing D/S may reduce enrollment, threaten financial stability of institutions (especially public and research universities), and erode local economic benefits derived from international education.\nThis proposed rule would create substantial operational challenges, impose financial hardships on international students, and ultimately undermine U.S. interests in maintaining educational excellence and economic competitiveness. Economic analyses suggest that policies creating barriers to international student enrollment could reduce participation by 15% or more, resulting in billions in lost revenue and significant job losses across university communities. •\tConducting impact analyses on potential enrollment declines and administrative costs before implementing sweeping regulatory changes. If specific security enhancements are needed, targeted improvements to existing systems would be more effective than wholesale changes that primarily burden compliant students and institutions. •\tEmpowering DSOs and universities with better training, resources, and communications to efficiently monitor status changes. The proposed rule would force students needing legitimate program extensions for common academic or medical reasons to file costly and stressful Extension of Stay (EOS) applications with an already overburdened USCIS. The proposed rule would force students needing legitimate program extensions for common academic or medical reasons to file costly and stressful Extension of Stay (EOS) applications with an already overburdened USCIS. The current D/S framework efficiently allows students to progress through their academic programs, including undertaking practical training or moving between degree levels, without requiring complex government adjudications. The NPRM's own analysis acknowledges the risk of reduced international student enrollment, which would be a devastating blow to American universities that rely on this revenue to fund research, support domestic students, and sustain their operations. The NPRM's own analysis acknowledges the risk of reduced international student enrollment, which would be a devastating blow to American universities that rely on this revenue to fund research, support domestic students, and sustain their operations. This proposal, while framed as a measure to enhance program oversight, is a burdensome and counterproductive policy shift that will inflict significant harm on international students, the U.S. education industry, and the nation's economic and cultural interests. Furthermore, the arbitrary limitations, such as the 24-month cap on language training, ignore diverse and valid educational paths, undermining the flexibility that is a hallmark of American higher education. Furthermore, the arbitrary limitations, such as the 24-month cap on language training, ignore diverse and valid educational paths, undermining the flexibility that is a hallmark of American higher education. More alarmingly, the proposal will make the U.S. a far less attractive destination for the world's brightest students, who will opt for competitor nations with more welcoming immigration policies. This new financial strain and the anxiety of a pending application will detract from their ability to focus on their studies—the very purpose of their presence in the United States. This new financial strain and the anxiety of a pending application will detract from their ability to focus on their studies—the very purpose of their presence in the United States. DHS already has tools like SEVIS monitoring and targeted enforcement to address bad actors. DHS already has tools like SEVIS monitoring and targeted enforcement to address bad actors. I urge the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS to withdraw this proposal and instead focus on targeted, enforceable policies that address abuse while maintaining the integrity and strength of the U.S. international education system. Imposing rigid restrictions that create uncertainty and limit post-graduation opportunities will inevitably deter future students from choosing the United States, weakening both higher education institutions and the U.S. labor market. As an international student who plans to pursue Optional Practical Training (OPT) after graduation, this rule would directly and severely affect my academic and professional trajectory in the United States. Blocking this pathway would stifle intellectual growth, limit academic freedom, and diminish the global competitiveness of U.S. higher education institutions, which thrive on offering flexible and interdisciplinary opportunities to international students. Proposed Policy Will Have Detrimental Impacts on the U.S. Economy and Higher Education System\nThis proposed rule, which significantly alters the duration of status for international students, is a misguided and harmful policy that will have severe negative consequences for the United States. Conclusion\n\nAs a student set to graduate in 2026, I am deeply concerned about the chilling effect this rule will have on my own future and on the ability of the United States to attract and retain international talent. Negative Impact on U.S. Education and Economy\n\nInternational students are a vital part of U.S. academic and economic ecosystems. Increased Administrative Burden and System Backlogs\nThe new policy would require hundreds of thousands of international students to file annual or multi-year extensions of stay (Form I-539). If enacted, these changes would reduce the attractiveness of U.S. education, drive talented students to competitor countries (such as Canada, the UK, and Australia), and diminish the billions of dollars international students contribute annually to the U.S. economy through tuition, living expenses, and tax revenue. Economically, international students added over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy in recent years, sustaining hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide. Preserving Duration of Status, maintaining a 60-day OPT grace period, and allowing academic flexibility are essential to upholding the integrity and purpose of the F-1 visa program, supporting U.S. education, and strengthening the nation’s economy. This change directly undermines the objectives of the OPT program, which was designed to allow international graduates to contribute their skills to the U.S. workforce and gain practical training in their fields. The 240-day grace period for extensions, while seemingly generous, is completely unrealistic given the current processing times and the massive influx of new applications this rule would create. While the stated goal may be to address issues like abuse of the CPT system, this regulation is a heavy-handed, counterproductive measure that will harm our economy, overburden our immigration system, and damage our standing as a global leader in higher education. This could include limiting the number of times a student can use CPT, establishing stricter time limits, and increasing oversight and auditing of designated school officials (DSOs) and schools that authorize CPT. I urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this proposal and instead consider more targeted, evidence-based solutions. Limiting international students to fixed terms may seem to improve oversight, but it would backfire—reducing revenue and jobs, weakening education and research, harming U.S. competitiveness in the global talent market, and risking lasting damage to America’s strength and influence. Imposing arbitrary limits will drive top global talent to countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia—eroding America’s leadership in science and technology. Growing Disadvantage in the Global Talent Market\nCompetitor countries such as Canada, the UK, and Australia have actively relaxed and optimized their study-to-work pathways in order to attract top global talent. Conclusion\n\nThe DHS proposal would shrink the economic contributions of international students, overburden USCIS, weaken U.S. PhD programs, restrict academic flexibility, and undermine American innovation. Imposing fixed terms and requiring frequent renewals would introduce uncertainty, reduce the attractiveness of U.S. education and employment, and weaken the country’s competitive edge in producing scholarly publications, patents, and innovations in key industries such as semiconductors, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence. Restricting international student pathways would diminish campus diversity, weaken grassroots networks of trust, and reduce the United States’ cultural and academic influence abroad. Higher Education and Local Economic Setbacks\nInternational students contribute approximately $43.8 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support 378,000 jobs nationwide. According to NAFSA estimates, a 30–40% drop in new enrollments could lead to an overall 15% reduction in enrollment, resulting in nearly $7 billion in revenue losses and more than 60,000 jobs eliminated across states and school districts. According to NAFSA (2023), they contributed $40.1 billion to the U.S. economy and supported over 368,000 jobs. The shift from “Duration of Status” to fixed-term stays may aim to improve oversight, but it could have serious unintended consequences—hurting U.S. higher education, the economy, innovation, and global influence. A decline in international student enrollment caused by fixed-term restrictions would directly erode this revenue base. Risks of Unintentional Violations and Long-Term Consequences\nUnder the proposed framework, unlawful presence would begin immediately upon expiration of the fixed stay, more easily triggering 3- or 10-year reentry bans. Programs and institutions that rely heavily on international tuition and research labor—such as engineering, computer science, and laboratory-intensive fields, including many second- and third-tier state universities—would be disproportionately harmed. Frequent renewals and the risk of denials would undermine workforce planning, disrupt research timelines, and raise compliance and legal costs. The resulting delays and costs would disrupt student enrollment timelines and complicate employer hiring processes, generating inefficiencies throughout the system. Recommendations: DHS should retain D/S admission for F/J visa holders, preserve the 60-day grace period, allow automatic continuation of status and work authorization for timely extension filings, remove nationality-specific restrictions in the I-visa category, and focus oversight improvements on SEVIS audits, targeted vetting, and interagency data integration rather than burdensome paperwork. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and consider more targeted, less burdensome alternatives to address fraud and security concerns. ICEB-2025-0001\n\nI strongly oppose the DHS proposal “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media”. This creates a \"death spiral\" where a processing delay costs a student a job offer, nullifying a key benefit of their U.S. degree and a return on their immense educational investment. - The Job Offer \"Death Spiral\": For many students, Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a critical part of our education.\nThis rule would impose a new, recurring \"student tax\" in the form of EOS application fees, biometrics fees, and, for many, the necessary cost of legal consultation to ensure these critical applications are filed correctly. Higher education is one of America’s strongest soft-power assets; policies that create uncertainty and increase costs will deter global talent, jeopardize research initiatives, and push international collaboration to competitor nations with simpler systems. Forcing all students and scholars to file extensions through USCIS would overwhelm an already backlogged system, create delays, and raise costs for individuals and institutions. This rule, as proposed, would undermine the competitiveness of the U.S. higher education system and introduce profound uncertainty and financial strain into our academic pursuits. Restrictions on work during pending cases: Preventing employment continuation while awaiting extension approvals creates unnecessary hardship and undermines OPT/STEM OPT programs. Imposition of a Crushing Financial Burden: International students already pay exceptionally high tuition fees—often two to three times the rate of domestic students—and are severely restricted in our ability to work. PhD programs in the sciences and humanities, as well as complex dual-degree tracks, routinely take five to seven years to complete (see https://cgsnet.org/resources/phd-completion-and-attrition-analysis-of-baseline-data/). Please do not sacrifice the stability and success of hundreds of thousands of legitimate students who contribute so much to the academic, cultural, and economic life of this nation. The possibility that an Extension of Stay (EOS) application could be delayed or denied by USCIS would hang over our heads, creating immense stress and distracting us from our primary purpose in this country. International students and scholars contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy and sustain hundreds of thousands of jobs. This proposed rule would harm U.S. higher education finances, misrepresent the realities of academic pathways, and impose impractical restrictions on international students who are already among the most documented visa holders. Conclusion\nEliminating D/S and imposing rigid admission limits will destabilize higher education finances, restrict legitimate academic pursuits, and damage U.S. competitiveness. Fiscal Harm to Higher Education\nInternational students provide vital tuition revenue. ICEB-2025-0001\nIntroduction:\nI strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with fixed periods of authorized stay. ICEB-2025-0001 — Comment Opposing Proposed Elimination of Duration of Status (D/S)\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nI respectfully oppose DHS’s proposal to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F, J, and I visa holders. F-1 Students Are Already the Most Documented Visa Holders\nF-1 students are among the most closely monitored visa categories:\n\nSEVIS tracks enrollment, program changes, and employment authorization in real time. This rule would disrupt legitimate academic paths, deter high-skilled talent, burden students and institutions, and unfairly restrict educational freedom. Banning same- or lower-level study cuts off legitimate, career-relevant educational paths and limits international students’ adaptability in the job market. Recommendation for a More Logical Framework\nRather than eliminating D/S, DHS should modernize the system by:\n\nAllowing students to pursue up to three academic programs at the same degree level, provided each program is distinct and career-relevant. Reducing the Grace Period Is Unreasonable\nThe proposal to shorten the F-1 grace period from 60 days to 30 days is highly impractical:\n\nUSCIS processing times are notoriously slow, with change-of-status or work authorization requests often taking many months. Retaining the 60-day grace period as the minimum, given USCIS’s slow processing times. Imposing harsher restrictions based on immigration status creates a two-tier academic system that conflicts with values of fairness and equal opportunity. The Rule Creates Academic Inequity\nDomestic students can change majors, extend study time, and pursue new degrees as needed. The Four-Year Cap Will Deter PhD Talent and Undermine Research\nPhD programs, particularly in STEM, often require five to seven years. Replacing the four-year admission cap with a default period that reflects actual academic norms (e.g., seven years for doctoral study). Creates Immense and Unnecessary Financial and Administrative Burdens:\nThe proposed rule would force hundreds of thousands of students and exchange visitors to file costly and time-consuming Extension of Stay (EOS) applications (Form I-539) with USCIS. I have deep concern regarding the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” with a fixed four-year cap for F and J visas. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) with a fixed 4-year admission period for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. It would create immense financial and administrative burdens, damage the competitiveness of U.S. higher education and cultural exchange, and is an inefficient solution to the problems it seeks to solve. In conclusion:\nThe proposed changes create needless obstacles for international students, jeopardize research progress, and damage the long-term competitiveness of U.S. higher education. This additional uncertainty will discourage talented international students from pursuing education in the United States, representing a direct loss to universities and the nation’s research competitiveness. This constitutes a significant new tax on international students and scholars for the privilege of completing their degrees and programs, which were designed to last longer than 4 years (e.g., Ph.D. programs, medical residencies). Replacing it with a rigid, arbitrary 4-year limit—and a burdensome extension process—sends a clear message that international students are not welcome. This will inevitably drive talented students to competitor countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, which offer more stable and welcoming immigration pathways. I strongly urge DHS to reconsider this proposal and preserve the current system of duration of status, which allows students to complete their studies without unnecessary disruption, while still ensuring compliance with immigration rules. This proposal would impose severe and unnecessary burdens on international students, universities, and ultimately the U.S. research ecosystem. Inefficient and Misguided Approach to National Security and Fraud:\nThe premise that replacing D/S with a fixed period will significantly enhance national security is weak. Imposing rigid timelines, burdensome extensions, and an unreasonably short grace period risks driving this vital community away. Even a short delay in processing could push a student into unlawful status, despite their academic progress. Additionally, the 30-day grace period after graduation is unreasonably short. Re: Docket ICEB-2025-0001 — Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\n\nAs an international graduate student studying in the United States, I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F-1 students and J-1 exchange visitors (capped at 4 years), and to limit I-visa admissions (foreign media) to 240 days (90 days for PRC passport holders), with added restrictions on program changes and a reduced 30-day post-completion period for F-1 students. 5) The I-visa limits chill the press and cultural exchange:\nCapping I-visa admissions at 240 days (with 90-day limits for PRC passport holders) fragments coverage of U.S. science, arts, and culture into short, precarious stints. 3) Cutting F-1’s post-completion period to 30 days is unworkable:\nReducing the long-standing 60-day post-completion period to 30 days compresses time for graduates to move apartments, wrap up research obligations, secure cap-gap coverage, or file timely extensions or changes of status. 6) The rule imposes significant, acknowledged costs:\nDHS’s own analysis estimates tens of millions of dollars per year in annualized costs borne by U.S. parties (schools, sponsors, employers)—resources that would otherwise fund classrooms, labs, and student support. Schools, sponsors, and employers are required to update every major change, from enrollment to program completion, giving DHS full visibility into the status of every student or exchange visitor. DHS’s own analysis acknowledges that this rule will impose hundreds of millions of dollars in costs over the next decade — costs that will be borne by students, schools, and employers, not DHS. Requiring mid-program extensions will force many graduate students to navigate new USCIS filings, fees, biometrics, and possible processing delays while they’re in the most research-intensive phases of their programs. This rule would force them to process extension applications, diverting critical time and resources away from academic advising, student support, and program quality. Students, researchers, and their families will be left to navigate a maze of filings, fees, and unpredictable adjudications, all while trying to focus on their education, research, or work. Those burdens land on Designated School Officials, Responsible Officers, and campus legal/compliance teams, diverting attention from student success and program quality. Fixed terms will erode those benefits, hurt institutions and communities, and damage the United States’ standing as a global leader in education, research, and innovation. The fixed admission periods will force students and researchers to pause critical work to file extensions or, worse, leave projects unfinished because of bureaucratic delays. International students bring billions of dollars into the U.S. economy every year and play a vital role in driving innovation and supporting industries that rely on global talent, especially in STEM fields. Recent SEVIS data show robust growth in OPT and STEM-OPT, meaning hundreds of thousands of graduates are already filling skill gaps in labs, startups, and studios nationwide.\nThe D/S framework has supported decades of academic growth, research breakthroughs, and cultural exchange, all while giving the government the oversight it needs. Dear Officer,\n\nI write in strong opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (ICEB-2025-0001). This proposal would dismantle that stability and introduce a new, costly, and time-consuming bureaucratic process: the Extension of Stay (EOS) application. ICEB-2025-0001, which proposes to eliminate the \"duration of status\" (D/S) admission period for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with a fixed time period. As a university professor with direct responsibility for mentoring international students and hosting visiting scholars, I have seen firsthand how vital the current “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework is to the success of our academic institutions and America’s standing as a global leader in education and research. By replacing D/S with fixed admission periods, this rule would introduce needless uncertainty, undermine America’s ability to attract global talent, and disrupt the very academic and cultural exchange programs that have long been a cornerstone of U.S. leadership. Conclusion\n\nThe current “Duration of Status” framework is effective and flexible, balancing the need for oversight with the realities of academic and research programs. While the stated goals of enhancing national security and preventing fraud are laudable, this proposed rule is a deeply concerning and counterproductive measure that would inflict significant harm on international students, academic institutions, and the economic and intellectual prosperity of the United States. Unnecessary for National Security\n\nDHS already has strong security and compliance measures, including SEVIS, visa vetting, and regular reporting requirements for schools and programs. Requiring thousands of additional extension applications will place an unmanageable administrative burden on both schools and USCIS. Instead, it diverts resources away from true enforcement priorities while penalizing students and scholars who are already closely monitored. It diverts time and resources away from education and towards paperwork. Loss of U.S. Competitiveness in Higher Education\n\nThe U.S. currently attracts more than one million international students annually, who contribute over $30 billion to the economy and support hundreds of thousands of jobs. Prohibiting Same-Level Degrees Is Unreasonable and Anti-Competitive:\nThe proposal to prohibit F-1 students from starting a new program at the same or a lower educational level (Proposed 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(ii)(C)) is fundamentally out of touch with modern education and career pathways. A person might change their entire career path, requiring a new degree in a completely different field of interest. It is perfectly reasonable for an individual to pursue a second, different degree at the same level. The Survey of Earned Doctorates from the National Science Foundation in 2024 estimates the average doctoral program takes 5.7 years, meaning that all doctoral international students would have to file an I-539 extension of stay form at least once. Almost every single doctoral student needing to file this form would significantly lengthen the wait time\nc. All of those students would have to submit extension requests for each year after the 4 year maximum, which would impose unnecessary costs and strain on USCIS and the broader immigration system. Currently, the USCIS processing times tool estimates that an I-539 extension review for F, J, and M visas takes 3.5 months, unless applicants pay a premium price of  $1,965. Administrative and Economic Burdens\nDHS estimates the rule will impose $390 million annually in costs on students, schools, and sponsors (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 103, §IV.C). ICEB-2025-0001)\n\nExecutive Summary\nI respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. I urge DHS not to implement the proposed changes to 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(i) and to maintain the current Duration of Status framework. Prohibiting graduate F-1 students from changing educational objectives or transferring from within the United States severely limits graduate-level study\n\n\nOverall, the proposal undermines America’s ability to attract global talent, weakens technological innovation, slows economic growth, and harms national interests. The current D/S framework already allows effective monitoring through SEVIS while supporting students’ contributions to innovation, workforce development, and long-term U.S. competitiveness. The proposed policy changes will lead to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of extension requests that the current staff level at DHS cannot handle. Risks to U.S. Economic and Social Stability\nInternational students and exchange visitors contributed tens of billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy before the pandemic, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in education and related industries. As an F-1 student and software quality assurance engineer, I believe this change undermines both the U.S. economy and the stability of its higher education system. In 2024-25, international students contributed an estimated $46 billion to the US economy and supported 400,000 jobs, but this year, NAFSA is estimating that newly implemented visa bans and regulations affecting international students will cost the economy $7 billion and 60,000 jobs. Students who currently contribute through research, Optional Practical Training (OPT), and eventual employment in high-demand fields like software engineering would face premature departure or status gaps. Recent data from the Association of American Universities shows that 73% of STEM international graduates continue to live and work in the US several years after graduation, providing vital scientific, technological, and economic benefits to the US. e. Designated School Officials (DSOs) would have to undergo additional training and adaptation, estimated to cost $93.3 million across the sector in year one. I write as a current doctoral student in the United States who is deeply concerned about the proposed changes to remove the Duration of Status (D/S) framework and replace it with a fixed admission period of four years or fewer. Position\n\nDHS should not implement the proposed changes and should preserve the current Duration of Status (D/S) framework. In the case of J-1 research scholars and medical residents/fellows (who often use J-1 visas), the 4-year cap is especially problematic – many medical training programs last 5–7 years. One analysis projects that a **30–40% decline in new international student enrollment (a plausible outcome if visa hurdles grow) could cost nearly $7 billion in lost revenue and 60,000 U.S. jobs in a single year. By contrast, visa restrictions this year alone are estimated to cost $7 billion and 60,000 jobs (NAFSA). Requiring I-539 extension of stay applications mid-degree creates several harms:\n\nAdministrative backlog: USCIS currently faces a record 11.3 million pending cases (Q2 FY2025). In the **2023–2024 academic year alone, international students contributed **$43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported about 378,000 American jobs through their spending. Broader Consequences\n\nInternational students contributed $46 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 400,000 jobs in 2024–25. Beyond economics, international students sustain America’s innovation engine: 43% of doctorate-level scientists and engineers in the U.S. are foreign-born (National Science Board, 2024), and 25% of U.S. billion-dollar startups were founded by former international students (NFAP, 2022). Like many of my peers, the pathway to my degree extends well beyond four years, and the proposed rule would introduce unnecessary risk, cost, and instability into both my studies and the broader U.S. academic system. The upshot is that critical academic and medical programs may face staffing gaps or lose talent due to the rigid timelines. From the perspective of U.S. national interests – including economic benefits, academic and scientific advancement, and global competitiveness – this proposed regulation raises several serious concerns. Below are key reasons why many in the higher education and research community believe the rule would be harmful to the United States, provided as potential points for a public comment. Requiring every international PhD student to apply for extensions during the middle of their program—at least once, often multiple times—adds precisely the kind of uncertainty that disrupts education, family stability, and research productivity. Imposing fixed time limits and ongoing uncertainty (mid-program extensions) will make the U.S. less attractive compared to countries like Canada, Australia, or Europe, which offer more predictable study pathways. I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule that would eliminate the “duration of status” admission period for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with fixed periods of admission and a new extension of stay procedure. I am writing to express my profound opposition to the proposed rule that seeks to eliminate \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with a fixed time period of admission. By replacing duration of status with rigid and uncertain timelines, the United States risks driving talent elsewhere. Negative Impact on International Media and Public Information\n\nFor I visa holders, limiting admission to 240 days undermines the ability of international journalists to conduct long-term reporting, investigations, or coverage of complex U.S. issues. Prohibiting mid-program changes or limiting admission to a rigid timeframe will discourage enrollment, disrupt ongoing projects, and erode the ability of institutions to adapt to the realities of education and research. Provide clear exceptions or streamlined extensions for I visa holders engaged in long-term or critical reporting projects.\nGlobal Competitiveness\n\nCountries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia are competing aggressively to attract international students, researchers, and media professionals. Let us continue to foster an immigration system that welcomes the world's brightest, strengthens our nation, and upholds our values as a global leader in education and innovation. The United States is the world's leader in higher education, attracting the best and brightest minds from across the globe. Conclusion\n\nThe proposed rule imposes steep costs, reduces flexibility, and threatens the competitiveness of U.S. education, research, and media industries. I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and preserve the policies that continue to make the United States an attractive destination for global talent. For these reasons, I strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this damaging and counterproductive proposed rule in its entirety. If implemented, it would inflict substantial and unnecessary harm on American higher education, our nation's scientific and technological competitiveness, and our economy, all while failing to effectively address its stated security goals. This harms not only universities and employers, but also the broader economy and America’s role as a global leader in education, research, and cultural exchange. Students, exchange visitors, and researchers frequently need to adjust their academic programs, transfer departments, or extend their studies to complete research projects. ICEB–2025–0001\nRIN 1653–AA95\n\nI respectfully submit this comment opposing the proposed rule to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with fixed admission periods, along with its associated restrictions. Introduction\n\nI am submitting this comment in strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) proposed rule to eliminate the “duration of status” (D/S) admission for F and J nonimmigrants and replace it with fixed admission periods. Limiting students to fixed admission periods and restricting program changes will stifle academic freedom and harm U.S. universities’ ability to recruit and retain the best talent. It would:\n\nOverburden an already stretched USCIS\n\nImpose unnecessary financial costs on students\n\nCreate legal uncertainty for those in long academic programs\n\nDamage U.S. higher education’s global reputation\n\nFor these reasons, I urge DHS to rescind this rule and instead focus on modernizing, not complicating, the international student system. Replacing it with rigid timelines and unnecessary degree restrictions undermines U.S. higher education, innovation, and global competitiveness. Medical, legal, and combined-degree programs often exceed 4 years. Excessive Paperwork and USCIS Backlogs\n\nRequiring international students and exchange visitors to file Form I-539 to extend stay beyond an initial fixed period is an unnecessary bureaucratic burden. For students whose academic progression is linear and anticipated, forcing them to apply for extensions mid-degree increases the risk of unintentional status violations caused solely by processing delays, not non-compliance. Adding periodic Form I-539 filings (currently $470 plus biometrics) — alongside Form I-765 filings for OPT/STEM extensions — creates a pay-to-stay system that disproportionately affects students with limited financial resources. The provision barring students from pursuing same- or lower-level degrees is especially damaging, as it restricts legitimate academic pursuits and unfairly disadvantages international students compared to their domestic peers. Prohibition on Pursuing Same or Lower-Level Degrees\n\nThe proposed restriction preventing F-1 students from pursuing another degree at the same or lower level (e.g., a second master’s program, or moving from master’s to bachelor’s) is particularly harmful and misguided. Legitimate Academic Needs: Many professionals seek a second master’s in a different field (e.g., a computer science graduate pursuing an MBA) to broaden expertise and career options. Redundant Given SEVIS Oversight\n\nDHS already has SEVIS, which provides real-time reporting on student enrollment, program progress, and compliance. Unnecessary Burden on Students and Institutions\n\nThe proposal introduces costly and time-consuming requirements for visa extensions, biometric collection, and repeated interaction with USCIS. Forcing students in these programs to apply for mid-course extensions will create stress, uncertainty, and potentially deter the best and brightest from choosing U.S. institutions in the first place. This change will:\n\nGenerate hundreds of thousands of additional filings annually;\n\nDramatically increase USCIS backlogs, delaying other immigration petitions;\n\nPut students at risk of falling out of status due to processing delays;\n\nOverburden Designated School Officials (DSOs) and universities. A more targeted approach would be:\n\nSet clearer limits on CPT eligibility and duration;\n\nStrengthen oversight of Designated School Officials (DSOs);\n\nEnforce compliance against schools that systematically abuse CPT rules. It would also increase workload for university Designated School Officials (DSOs), diverting resources from student support and academic guidance. I urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw or significantly revise this proposal in ways that target abuse without undermining the many benefits international students bring to the United States. Economic Impact\nInternational students contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy, support hundreds of thousands of jobs, and help subsidize tuition for domestic students. By creating unnecessary uncertainty and barriers, this proposal will discourage talented students from choosing U.S. institutions, directly harming universities, local communities, and the broader economy. Safeguarding against abuse is important, but blanket prohibitions on second degrees, restrictions on graduate transfers, and a four-year maximum admission period for all students—particularly PhDs—will harm students, damage universities, and weaken U.S. leadership in higher education and innovation. I am deeply concerned about the proposed rule’s provisions that would prohibit students from (1) pursuing a second degree at the same level, (2) changing programs or transferring schools at the graduate level, and (3) replacing Duration of Status (D/S) with fixed admission periods capped at four years. Academic and Career Realities\n\nIt is very common for students to pursue multiple degrees at the same level for legitimate reasons:\n\nMany Executive MBA (EMBA) and MBA programs report that half or more of their students already hold a Master’s or Ph.D. Unreasonable Restrictions on Program Changes\nThe proposal limits the ability of students to pursue additional degrees (e.g., a second master’s, or switching from a STEM PhD to a law or business program). Unrealistic for PhD Programs\nMany doctoral programs in STEM fields require 5–6 years to complete, sometimes longer in the humanities and social sciences. PhD Programs Are Incompatible with a Four-Year I-94\n\nMost PhD programs—especially in STEM—require 5–6 years to complete, and humanities and social sciences often take even longer. Limiting admission to a maximum of four years will force the vast majority of PhD students to file at least one Extension of Stay (EOS), creating unnecessary administrative burden and legal risk. Increased USCIS Burden and Backlogs\nThe rule would force hundreds of thousands of students to file Form I-539 extensions annually. While I understand the government’s intent to strengthen oversight of student status, I believe this rule, if implemented, will harm U.S. national interests in multiple dimensions: economic competitiveness, administrative efficiency, and America’s role in attracting global talent. I respectfully submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule entitled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” While I recognize the Department of Homeland Security’s responsibility to safeguard the integrity of the immigration system, I believe this rule would cause serious harm to U.S. educational institutions, students, and the broader academic community. Excessive Administrative and Economic Burden\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) itself has estimated the annualized social cost at $390–392 million, with over 400,000 EOS applications expected every year (90 FR 42074; “Summary of Costs and Benefits”). I strongly oppose the proposal to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) and replace it with fixed admission periods coupled with frequent extensions of stay (EOS) for F-1, J-1, and I visa holders. The current “duration of status” framework allows international students to remain in the United States as long as they are making normal progress toward their degree. Introducing greater uncertainty and bureaucratic friction will weaken the United States’ ability to attract and retain global talent, particularly in high-demand scientific and technological fields, where competition from other countries is intensifying. A four-year maximum stay would force normal, expected doctoral timelines into repeated EOS filings, interrupting research continuity and creating recurring uncertainty at the very moment when the U.S. seeks to attract and retain top scientific and technical talent. Imposing rigid admission periods will harm students, weaken U.S. institutions, and undermine our position as a global leader in higher education. By imposing rigid admission periods capped at four years, the proposed rule disregards the realities of higher education. Forcing students into fixed admission periods will create unnecessary stress and disruption. This policy change would impose significant and unnecessary burdens on students, universities, and government agencies, while also undermining the United States’ competitiveness in higher education and scientific innovation. Unwarranted Restrictions on Academic Flexibility\n\nThe proposed revisions to 8 CFR 214.2(f)—including a one-year bar on transfer, a prohibition against graduate-level program changes, and a ban on pursuing a second program at the same level—are overly restrictive. Erosion of U.S. Competitiveness in Global Higher Education\n\nIn the 2023/24 academic year, international students contributed approximately $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,000 jobs. •\tIf fixed terms are implemented, establish a minimum baseline of six years for doctoral and other long-duration programs to reflect academic realities.\nSTEM programs, particularly in the sciences and engineering, often require extended lab-based research, which depends on funding cycles, publication timelines, and experimental results. For example, some programs in the humanities or social sciences may extend beyond four years because of the depth of research and the time needed for fieldwork or archival studies. I respectfully and strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposal of Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media. Introducing hundreds of thousands of additional extension filings will create cascading delays affecting not just students but the entire immigration system. Global Competitiveness\nInternational students and exchange visitors are ambassadors of American education, innovation, and culture. I respectfully but firmly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with a fixed admission period. I submit these comments in strong opposition to the proposed rule replacing Duration of Status (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Forcing hundreds of thousands of additional extension-of-stay filings each year would exacerbate backlogs, undermine efficiency, and place an unreasonable strain on government resources. Under the proposal, however, students who are applying for OPT or STEM OPT would need to file both Form I-765 and Form I-539, creating serious risks: dual adjudication, two applications increase the chance of delay or denial; timing problems, USCIS backlogs already slow EAD processing, adding I-539 would make on-time approval even less certain; workforce disruption, missed approvals would leave students unable to contribute to STEM, healthcare, and other high-need fields. I am deeply concerned this change would create unnecessary uncertainty, add administrative burdens, and weaken the United States in education, research, healthcare, and the economy. Harm to U.S. Higher Education and Research\nThis proposal would impose constant uncertainty on international students and scholars, who already contribute billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy. The Department's cost analysis fails to account for opportunity costs—the research projects delayed, the startup companies not founded, and the patents not filed due to status uncertainty. Research by the National Foundation for American Policy demonstrates that 44% of US billion-dollar startup companies were founded by immigrants, with many initially entering on student visas. International students are already essential—nearly half of all STEM Ph.D.s in the U.S. are earned by them, and disrupting their status would undercut the institutions and projects that depend on them. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue targeted reforms that strengthen oversight without undermining America's competitive position in the global talent market. As a global talent strategy consultant, I am deeply concerned about the strategic implications this policy will have on America's position in the international competition for human capital. Conclusion: I support DHS’s mission to ensure accountability, but this proposal would harm legitimate students, overburden USCIS and consulates, and weaken America’s global competitiveness. My specific points of opposition are as follows:\n\n\nCreates Excessive Burdens on Individuals: The proposed rule would shift F, J, and I nonimmigrants from admission for duration of status to a fixed time period. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule change that would eliminate \"duration of status\" for F-1 international students. I am writing to submit a formal comment in opposition to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding the elimination of \"duration of status\" for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, as published in the Federal Register on August 28, 2025. The current population of over one million international students supports hundreds of thousands of American jobs, contributes tens of billions of dollars to the economy, provides significant tax revenue, and helps subsidize tuition costs for domestic students. Creation of an Unmanageable Administrative Burden: This policy would mandate that hundreds of thousands of students file for an I-539 extension of stay annually. The rule itself acknowledges that DSOs and ROs would incur significant costs for familiarization and adaptation, estimated at between $10.1 million and $11.8 million annually. Rather than dismantling this framework, DHS should focus on strengthening it by enhancing training and vetting for school officials and using SEVIS data more effectively to identify fraud indicators, as recommended by the Government Accountability Office. Designated School Officials (DSOs) and Responsible Officers (ROs) would be required to advise a large volume of individuals on a new, complex EOS process. The current duration of status (D/S) framework, supported by the robust Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), already provides significant oversight. It will harm individuals, educational institutions, and the standing of the United States as a global leader in education and research. The current system, which relies on SEVIS and the diligent work of DSOs and ROs, provides a robust and effective mechanism for oversight. My primary concerns are as follows:\n\nSevere and Counterproductive Economic Impact: International students are a vital economic engine for the United States. An Incorrect and Overly Broad Solution to a Targeted Problem: If the administration's goal is to address potential misuse of programs like Curricular Practical Training (CPT) to circumvent visa caps, this policy is an ineffective and punishingly broad approach. This would require those who need more time to complete their programs to apply for an Extension of Stay (EOS) directly with U.S. It is common and professionally valuable for an individual with a business master's to pursue a second master's in computer science, or for a STEM PhD graduate to later pursue an MBA or a law degree (LL.M./J.D.) By requiring students to file extension of stay applications (Form I-539) for normal academic progress, DHS is shifting unnecessary administrative burdens and costs onto students, schools, and USCIS. The proposed rule will harm the U.S. higher education system, reduce global competitiveness, and impose unnecessary costs without providing meaningful benefits. Without this pipeline of talent, the United States risks losing ground in global high-tech competition to other countries that are actively attracting and retaining this workforce. Maintaining the Duration of Status (D/S) system and the current 60-day grace period serves the best interests of students, universities, employers, and the United States as a whole. As someone who came to the United States as an international student, I completed both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree under the current “duration of status” framework. Burden on Students and Schools\n\nThe current Duration of Status (D/S) framework is simple, flexible, and effective. To the Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI am writing in opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n________________________________________\n1. This change offers no measurable security benefit but imposes severe hardships on tens of thousands of students every year. ________________________________________\nConclusion\n\nFor these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposal. Economic and National Competitiveness Impact\n\nInternational students contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Likewise, reducing the grace period from 60 days to 30 days would have made it far more difficult for me—and many other students—to smoothly transition to OPT, interviews, or job placements. Unnecessary Reduction of Grace Period\n\nThe proposal shortens the F-1 grace period from 60 to 30 days, which severely impacts students’ ability to:\n•\tMake travel and housing arrangements. Graduate programs often extend beyond four years, and frequent extensions or reapplications would have created uncertainty and financial burdens. By creating uncertainty and pressure through rigid time limits and reduced flexibility, fewer students will choose the U.S. as their study destination. Roughly 70% of full-time graduate students in AI-related programs are international, and non-U.S. citizens earn more than half of all AI-relevant PhDs at U.S. universities. For the reasons above—lack of a D/S-specific compliance problem, serious economic harms (especially to Texas), administrative burdens and status-gap risks, press-freedom concerns, and inadequate justification for reversing the 2021 withdrawal—I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this NPRM and pursue targeted improvements within the proven D/S framework. The rule imposes significant economic and administrative costs without demonstrating a D/S-specific compliance problem; it also revives a framework DHS withdrew in 2021 after extensive critical comments, raising Administrative Procedure Act concerns for an inadequately explained policy reversal. I urge DHS to withdraw this NPRM in its entirety, as it imposes unnecessary burdens, undermines the integrity of U.S. higher education and innovation ecosystems, and fails to demonstrate sufficient justification for such sweeping changes. I am a U.S. citizen residing in Texas, and I oppose DHS’s proposal to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods and a new extension-of-stay process for F-1 academic students, J-1 exchange visitors, and I-visa foreign information media. Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register on August 28, 2025, which seeks to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) admissions for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace them with fixed admission periods, mandatory Extension of Stay (EOS) applications, and other restrictive measures. The NPRM caps F/J admissions at the program end date not to exceed four years, then forces predictable milestones (multi-year PhDs, program changes, OPT/STEM-OPT bridges) into USCIS extension adjudications.\nWhen combined with national data showing international students contribute $43.8 billion and support ~378,000 U.S. jobs, it is clear the proposed rule cuts against the economic interests of Texas communities—from Austin’s labs to Denton’s small businesses. If DHS seeks better compliance or data quality, it can strengthen risk-based SEVIS alerts, school liaison practices, data reconciliation, and targeted investigations—without imposing blanket fixed terms and mass extension filings that will choke USCIS workflows and penalize compliant students, scholars, and journalists in Texas and nationwide. The U.S. benefits immensely from F-1 students: in FY 2023 alone, over 1.6 million F admissions contributed to economic growth, with international students adding $40 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 300,000 jobs, according to data from NAFSA: Association of International Educators. The proposed reduction of the post-completion grace period from 60 to 30 days (page 13) further exacerbates this, leaving insufficient time for transitions to H-1B or other statuses amid visa caps and lotteries. For foreign information media, the rule reduces admission to 240 days, and reporting indicates a 90-day cap for Chinese journalists—disrupting coverage and inviting retaliatory restrictions on American reporters abroad. The proposal tightens the student grace period to 30 days and caps aggregate English-language training at 24 months. The NPRM's stance that delays from academic probation or \"repeated inability to complete\" are generally unacceptable for extensions (page 13 of the document) penalizes legitimate challenges like health issues or unforeseen research setbacks, without adequate evidence that the current SEVIS system and DSO oversight are insufficient. Adding fixed end-dates and mid-program USCIS filings invites delays, RFEs, and uncertainty that will deter enrollment, shrink local spending, and weaken Texas’s research and startup ecosystem. Prohibiting graduate students from changing programs mid-study, requiring completion of the first academic year before transfers, and disallowing changes to the same or lower educational levels ignore the realities of academic and career development. Rather than imposing arbitrary time limits, I encourage focusing on:\n\nStreamlining processing times for legitimate students\nEnhancing monitoring of student progress through existing institutional reporting\nSupporting pathways for graduates to contribute their skills to the U.S. economy\n\nThe proposed changes would undermine decades of successful policy that have made the United States the world's premier destination for higher education while contributing significantly to American economic and technological leadership. Reducing international enrollment through restrictive visa policies would:\n\nDecrease revenue for universities, particularly those in states like Iowa that rely heavily on international student contributions\nReduce tax revenue generated by international students and their families\nIncrease administrative burden on USCIS as more students would need to apply for extensions or alternative visa categories\nCreate processing backlogs and strain an already overburdened immigration system\n\n4. Economic Interests: Harm to U.S. Competitiveness\n\nInternational students and scholars contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of American jobs in universities, housing, healthcare, retail, and technology sectors. Implementing restrictive time limits risks:\n\nDriving talented students to competitor nations from the outset\nReducing the U.S. pipeline of skilled researchers and innovators\nWeakening America's position in global competition for talent\nUndermining the research capacity of U.S. universities and industries\n\nI strongly recommend maintaining the current F-1 visa framework, which already includes appropriate oversight mechanisms while providing necessary flexibility for legitimate academic pursuits. By shortening grace periods and imposing arbitrary admission caps, the proposed rule sends the message that the U.S. is unwelcoming—undermining our long-term strategic interest in maintaining global leadership in science, defense, and technology. Protecting America’s national security and immigration integrity is essential, but the current proposal risks damaging America’s competitiveness, overburdening our agencies, and discouraging the very talent that strengthens our economy and innovation. Imposing an arbitrary 4-year limit would force students to either abandon their studies mid-program or rush through critical research phases, ultimately diminishing the quality of scholarship and innovation that has made American universities global leaders in research and development. Long-term Competitiveness Concerns\nThe United States has historically attracted the world's brightest minds through welcoming educational policies. I respectfully urge the retention of current F-1 visa regulations and oppose the implementation of the proposed 4-year time limitation. The proposed time limit would eliminate this flexibility, forcing students into rigid pathways that may not serve their academic or professional development, nor the research needs of their institutions. Increase penalties for institutions or students who abuse the system. Instead of strengthening enforcement, this policy would create backlogs at USCIS, delaying adjudications for U.S. workers, H-1B petitions, family-based cases, and even asylum or security-related reviews. PhD programs, particularly in STEM fields, typically require 5-7 years to complete, including coursework, comprehensive examinations, research, and dissertation writing. Students may need to change advisors, modify research directions, or even switch programs based on evolving interests or circumstances. Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register on August 28, 2025, which seeks to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) admissions for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace them with fixed admission periods, mandatory Extension of Stay (EOS) applications, and other restrictive measures. I urge DHS to withdraw this NPRM in its entirety, as it imposes unnecessary burdens, undermines the integrity of U.S. higher education and innovation ecosystems, and fails to demonstrate sufficient justification for such sweeping changes. It Undermines the U.S. Higher Education System\n\nThis regulation introduces unnecessary uncertainty by eliminating “duration of status” (D/S) and replacing it with fixed-term visa periods. DHS rejected shorter caps or retaining D/S until departure (page 10), but offers no compelling data that the current system—bolstered by SEVP, SEVIS, and post-9/11 reforms—poses genuine national security risks warranting these changes. The NPRM's stance that delays from academic probation or \"repeated inability to complete\" are generally unacceptable for extensions (page 13 of the document) penalizes legitimate challenges like health issues or unforeseen research setbacks, without adequate evidence that the current SEVIS system and DSO oversight are insufficient. SEVIS, mandated by IIRIRA and enhanced post-9/11, already provides robust tracking; DHS's claim of monitoring challenges (pages 7-10) lacks empirical data showing widespread fraud in F-1 programs, relying instead on anecdotal \"examples of students staying for decades\" (page 8) that represent outliers, not the norm. The U.S. benefits immensely from F-1 students: in FY 2023 alone, over 1.6 million F admissions contributed to economic growth, with international students adding $40 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 300,000 jobs, according to data from NAFSA: Association of International Educators. It Will Harm U.S. Institutions Financially\n\nInternational students contributed $38.7 billion to the U.S. economy in 2019 alone and supported over 400,000 jobs. Third, this rule would harm broader U.S. interests by deterring international talent. First, the proposal's transition from D/S to a fixed 4-year admission cap is arbitrary and disruptive, particularly for students in long-term programs like STEM fields. As an F-1 student currently on STEM OPT, this proposal would directly and adversely impact my ability to pursue future educational opportunities in the United States. Prohibiting graduate students from changing programs mid-study, requiring completion of the first academic year before transfers, and disallowing changes to the same or lower educational levels ignore the realities of academic and career development. By aligning F-1 with more rigid classifications, the NPRM risks reducing U.S. competitiveness in global education, as students opt for more welcoming countries like Canada or Australia. This rule, pushed through late in an administration, would fundamentally harm the United States’ leadership in higher education, innovation, and global competitiveness. It Adds Unnecessary Bureaucracy and Cost\n\nThe rule proposes arbitrary timelines (e.g., 2-year limits for certain countries) and additional extension requirements, burdening both students and an already overwhelmed USCIS. I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule to eliminate the current “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework for F-1, J-1, and I visa holders and replace it with a rigid fixed-period admission and extension-of-stay (EOS) regime. The proposed rule would replace this flexibility with a maximum four-year/30-day-grace admission capped to program end dates, requiring repetitive EOS filings for any delay or extension . The proposed change would begin unlawful presence accrual **immediately after expiration of the fixed period**, even if an extension application is delayed by USCIS’s own processing backlogs. ---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThis proposed rule would harm U.S. higher education, reduce our ability to attract global talent, burden USCIS with unnecessary applications, and impose severe penalties on individuals who are currently maintaining lawful status. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety and maintain the Duration of Status framework. While I recognize DHS’s interest in ensuring compliance with immigration law, this rule would impose unnecessary burdens on students, exchange visitors, media professionals, and U.S. institutions, while offering little evidence of actual benefit to national security or immigration enforcement. Global Leadership\nTaken together, lower international enrollment reduces tuition revenue, depletes pools of skilled researchers and innovators, and shrinks consumer demand in sectors like housing, travel, retail, and hospitality.\nI will focus on the rule’s anticipated deleterious consequences for the U.S. education, technology, and travel sectors—and by extension, its negative impact on overall domestic economic demand. **Negative Impact on U.S. Competitiveness and Diplomacy**\n\n* International students and exchange visitors contribute billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy, enrich American classrooms, and foster long-term goodwill toward the United States. * Students and exchange visitors will bear additional financial costs for filing fees and biometrics, which disproportionately impacts individuals from lower-income backgrounds. * USCIS already faces significant processing backlogs; adding a new layer of mandatory applications will exacerbate delays for all applicants, including U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who rely on USCIS for family petitions and naturalization. Institutions estimate training DSOs and advising staff, adapting processes, and helping students navigate repetitive EOS filings would cost tens of millions in year one alone . Lower foreign-student retention weakens innovation ecosystems, delays technology transfer, and restricts firms’ ability to hire quickly—constraining productivity and competitiveness. * U.S. universities rely on their ability to attract and retain top global talent. Choking Innovation in the Technology and Research Sectors\nInternational students are core contributors to technology, research, and innovation. Retaining the Duration of Status framework is essential to maintaining the strength of American higher education, protecting the well-being of international students, and preserving the United States’ leadership in science, technology, and global knowledge production. I write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the long-standing Duration of Status framework with fixed admission periods for international students. The proposed replacement of “Duration of Status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F-1 students represents a structural change with measurable costs and questionable benefits. Shortening the grace period after program completion from sixty days to thirty would further destabilize students’ plans, leaving them little time to prepare for transitions to employment, further study, or departure. Introducing fixed visa periods and mandatory extension-of-stay (EOS) filings creates uncertainty in program completion and post-graduation training, which directly influences enrollment decisions. Canada has extended post-study work eligibility and streamlined transitions to permanent residence. They bring global perspectives and cultural diversity to universities, contribute tens of billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy, and play a vital role in sustaining innovation, particularly in STEM fields. Administrative Burden and Processing Delays\nDHS has not provided an estimate of additional Form I-539 filings triggered by this change, but sector analyses suggest tens of thousands annually. DHS itself estimates that institutions would bear nearly $100 million in additional costs in the first year alone, not accounting for hidden costs associated with lost enrollment and disrupted academic planning. Economic Contributions of International Students\nAccording to NAFSA’s 2023 report, international students contributed over $40 billion to the U.S. economy and supported nearly 370,000 jobs nationwide. The proposed rule would undermine these contributions by significantly increasing the vulnerability of international students. Limited Evidence of Overstay Problem\nThe DHS 2019 Entry/Exit Overstay Report recorded an F-1 overstay rate of 1.52%—a figure significantly lower than the rates for several visitor visa categories. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia already offer more flexible and secure student visa policies, and students deterred by U.S. restrictions will simply redirect their aspirations there. Far from enhancing national security, the rule would erode the nation’s competitiveness and undermine its capacity for innovation. Even a 5% decline in enrollment (a realistic scenario given competing policies in Canada and the UK) could result in a $2 billion annual loss in tuition and local spending. The proposed rule threatens the U.S.’s ability to attract and retain top international STEM talent, disrupts academic progress, and undermines America’s global leadership in scientific and technological research. Research Productivity and Innovation\n\nPhD students are integral to the U.S. research engine. Retaining the D/S framework is not only about immigration—it is about preserving the very foundation of U.S. higher education and innovation. I am writing to respectfully oppose certain provisions of the proposed rule (2025-16554) that would eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F and J visa holders and replace it with a fixed admission period. By contrast, fixed admission periods (e.g., four years) would force students to interrupt research to apply for extensions, creating uncertainty about whether they can complete their work. The proposal to replace D/S with a fixed admission period requiring extensions creates risks that extend far beyond immigration oversight. Eliminating D/S and imposing fixed admission periods will inevitably reduce the number of international students, creating a broad negative impact on multiple sectors of the economy and higher education institutions. Many professionals pursue additional degrees to acquire complementary skills—for example, a business master’s graduate may study computer science or applied mathematics, or a STEM PhD graduate may pursue a business, law, or LLM/JD degree. Significant Economic and Educational Impact\n\nCurrently, the U.S. hosts over one million international students who contribute substantially to the economy, including generating tax revenue, supporting local employment, and alleviating tuition costs for domestic students. It introduces uncertainty into doctoral study, discourages enrollment, disrupts research productivity, and weakens U.S. competitiveness in the high-tech sector. It could discourage international students from pursuing PhDs in the U.S. and weaken America’s competitiveness in the high-tech sector. Incompatibility with PhD and Long-Term Programs\n\nA maximum four-year I-94 is unrealistic for PhD programs, particularly in STEM fields, which commonly require 5–6 years to complete; humanities and social sciences programs often take even longer. The removal of D/S risks sending a message that the U.S. no longer welcomes long-term academic engagement. Strategic Risks\n\nThe U.S. has maintained global leadership partly because it consistently attracted the best minds from around the world. Losing talent in these domains could mean ceding global leadership to competitors. ICEB-2025-0001**\nSubmitted via Regulations.gov\n\n#### Introduction\n\nI strongly oppose DHS’s proposal to eliminate the “duration of status” (D/S) framework for F-1 students and replace it with fixed admission periods. ### Comment Opposing NPRM ICEB-2025-0001: Proposed Replacement of “Duration of Status” (D/S) with Fixed Admission Periods for F-1 Students\n\n**Docket No. Fixed-term admissions create unnecessary uncertainty for students like me who have successfully maintained lawful status under the D/S framework. Damage to U.S. Higher Education\n\nU.S. business schools, including Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, depend on experienced professionals returning for advanced degrees to enrich classroom discussions with real-world perspectives. Deferred admission programs, increasingly popular at top business schools, would become meaningless for international students, eliminating a key recruitment tool for attracting experienced professionals to American MBA programs. DHS argues this change improves oversight and prevents fraud, but in practice it would impose disproportionate costs, uncertainty, and risks on law-abiding students while undermining U.S. higher education and competitiveness. My planned return to business school after gaining consulting experience represents exactly the type of academic-professional cycle that drives innovation. I have already received an offer for a deferred MBA program that I planned to pursue after gaining professional experience, which would be impossible under the proposed regulations. Harm to International Students\n\nReducing the post-completion grace period from 60 to 30 days creates unrealistic timelines for students transitioning from academic to professional life. If these rules are implemented, many talented students will choose Canada, the U.K., or other countries instead of the U.S., where educational systems offer more flexibility for career development and program changes. Imposing arbitrary limits makes U.S. institutions less attractive and reduces America’s ability to recruit global talent. By eliminating educational flexibility and reducing transition periods, the U.S. risks losing top global talent who are already contributing to the American economy. I am an international student from Beijing, China, currently working full-time on Optional Practical Training (OPT) as a Technology Consultant. My situation—working on OPT with plans for further education—represents exactly the type of committed, long-term engagement that benefits America. Broader Economic and Social Impact\n\nInternational students on OPT like me contribute significantly to the U.S. economy through our employment, tax payments, and consumption. I write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace “Duration of Status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods and frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) requirements for F-1, J-1, and I nonimmigrants. Comment on ICEB-2025-0001-0001: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media. This rule, with its arbitrarily short admission periods and punitive new standards, will actively dismantle the talent pipeline that is critical to U.S. economic and technological leadership. Harm to Interdisciplinary Research and Academic Freedom\n\nThe proposed restrictions on transfers and program changes—such as prohibiting graduate students from changing programs or re-enrolling at the same level—would block the natural flexibility that research requires. Robust, real-time monitoring of enrollment status and program progress is a far more effective and less damaging tool than the punitive, blanket restrictions proposed in ICEB-2025-0001. Conclusion:\nThis proposal would create overwhelming administrative costs, disrupt long-term study, prohibit interdisciplinary mobility, and ultimately diminish U.S. global leadership in education and innovation. - If fixed periods must be implemented, establish a baseline of at least 6 years for doctoral and other long-term programs.\nThis mismatch between the fixed period and real academic timelines will make U.S. programs less attractive to top global talent. Misalignment with Doctoral Timelines\n\nNSF data show the median time from enrollment to PhD completion is 6.8 years, with humanities often longer. This standard would penalize crucial, long-term research in favor of projects with immediate, obvious applications, thereby stifling the very kind of deep innovation America is known for. A four-year cap would force most doctoral students to file repeated EOS applications, disrupting research and diverting focus from academic work. Students and institutions should not be penalized with immediate unlawful presence for routine processing delays. Harsh Unlawful Presence Rules\n\nThe rule would count unlawful presence beginning the day after I-94 expiration, without grace periods if EOS is denied. - Preserve the 60-day grace period and provide at least 30 days for departure after EOS denial. I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and instead preserve D/S while strengthening targeted oversight of institutions that abuse the system. This proposed change would impose unnecessary costs, disrupt academic and professional development, and undermine America’s position as a global leader in higher education and innovation. Administrative Burden and Cost Inefficiency\n\nThe rule would force hundreds of thousands of students and exchange visitors to file repeated Extension of Stay (EOS) applications, each requiring adjudication by USCIS. Comment on rule ICEB-2025-0001:\n\n(1) Introduction\nAs an individual who has worked and studied within academic communities in the United States, I am deeply concerned about the proposed rule establishing a fixed time of admission for nonimmigrant academic students. I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace Duration of Status (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I visa holders. (5) Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed elimination of “duration of status” and replacement with fixed time limits for F, J, and I visa holders will weaken the U.S. academically, economically, and culturally. (4) Recommendations\nI strongly recommend that the agency:\n1.Withdraw the proposed rule and preserve the current “duration of status” framework. Conclusion\n\nThis rule revives administrative inefficiencies from the pre-1979 era, adds staggering costs, risks disrupting the educational missions of universities, and harms America’s competitiveness in STEM and global leadership. •Unintended Consequences for U.S. Competitiveness: The U.S. has historically been the global leader in attracting top international talent, especially in the STEM fields. This shift would alter a long-standing, flexible policy that has successfully governed the stay of international students, exchange visitors, and journalists for decades. This impact is especially severe at institutions where international graduate students make up a large share of enrollment, as their tuition often helps subsidize financial aid for domestic students, supports faculty research, and sustains academic programs. (3) Analysis\nThe proposed rule would have several negative consequences:\n•Academic and Research Disruption: Many degree programs, particularly Ph.D. and other advanced research tracks, often take longer than four years to complete due to the unpredictable nature of research. Even a modest 10% decline in enrollment would cost U.S. institutions an estimated $3 billion in total revenue, including $900 million in tuition losses (The Financial Times, 2025. •Administrative Burden on DHS and Universities: The rule will dramatically increase the number of extension applications submitted to USCIS, creating delays and higher costs. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead strengthen targeted oversight within the existing D/S framework. Redundancy Given Existing Oversight (SEVIS and DSOs)\n\nDHS justifies the rule by citing oversight concerns and risks of “fraud and abuse”. ICEB-2025-0001\n\nI respectfully submit this comment to oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) proposed rule titled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (Docket No. I urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this proposal and maintain the current, successful Duration of Status framework. •\tRedundancy: Current systems like SEVIS already track status in real time, making these new requirements unnecessary. While DHS cites goals of improving oversight and compliance, this proposal would create unnecessary administrative burdens, weaken U.S. higher education and research competitiveness, and deliver minimal security benefit. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule, \"Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure.\" ⸻\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed rule would impose unnecessary burdens on compliant students and institutions, harm U.S. education and research competitiveness, and provide minimal additional security. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based, targeted measures that support national security while preserving the U.S.’s position as a global leader in academic and cultural exchange. While the stated goals of enhancing program integrity and national security are commendable, this proposal is fundamentally flawed and would cause significant harm to the United States' educational system, economic competitiveness, and its standing as a premier destination for global talent. It will stifle academic innovation, burden universities and government agencies, damage our economy, and ultimately weaken America's position as a global leader in higher education and research. Any processing delay by USCIS could cause a student to fall out of status through no fault of their own, potentially accruing unlawful presence and facing severe penalties like a 3 or 10-year bar on re-entry. Administrative Burdens and Inefficiency\n\nThis proposal would dramatically increase the number of extension-of-stay filings, overwhelming USCIS and creating severe backlogs. •\tUSCIS workload: The agency already struggles with processing delays; imposing frequent extensions will worsen inefficiencies and slow other critical adjudications. Increased Uncertainty and \"Accrued Unlawful Presence\": The proposal's mechanism for extensions creates a high risk for students. Recommendations\n\nInstead of implementing fixed admission periods, DHS should:\n\t•\tStrengthen SEVIS auditing and data analysis to better identify risks. Replacing it with a fixed-term visa requiring extensions would create a massive new bureaucratic burden for U.S. Conclusion\nIn its current form, the proposed rule risks damaging the American economy, overloading immigration agencies, weakening higher education, and reducing U.S. competitiveness in science and technology. Imposing fixed time limits will create unnecessary uncertainty, harm workforce competitiveness, and discourage the very talent the United States depends upon to lead in technology and innovation. As an Apple software engineer who first came to the United States as an F-1 student, I have directly experienced how the current system supports educational achievement, career development, and contributions to the U.S. economy. By shortening grace periods and capping admissions at four years (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 87–89, §III.B) ￼, DHS would create instability that risks pushing future talent away from U.S. institutions and companies. Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI respectfully submit my comment regarding the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule on duration of status and restrictions on academic programs for international students. I urge DHS to withdraw the rule and retain the duration of status framework, strengthening oversight through existing systems instead of undermining America’s role as the global leader in education and technology. By making the United States less welcoming, this rule risks diverting talent to competitor nations such as Canada, which recently expanded post-study work rights for STEM graduates. Economic Costs and Talent Flight\nDHS acknowledges that the rule will impose nearly $400 million annually in costs on students, universities, and sponsors (p. 103, §IV.C) ￼. Conclusion\nThis proposal adds costs and uncertainty while discouraging the international students who become essential contributors to the U.S. workforce. Practical Alternatives\nTo safeguard both national security and economic vitality, DHS should:\n\t•\tRetain D/S while expanding targeted SEVIS compliance audits. More targeted approaches—such as stricter CPT reporting requirements, enhanced oversight of schools with unusually high CPT usage, and clearer limits on CPT duration—would address abuse without harming legitimate students and universities. Workforce Contributor\nMy academic training as an F-1 student allowed me to transition into the U.S. technology workforce through Optional Practical Training (OPT). Companies like Apple rely on a steady pipeline of graduates from U.S. universities to sustain innovation. This will delay adjudications not only for students, but also for American families, workers, and employers who rely on USCIS for timely processing. However, SEVIS already provides real-time data on enrollment, employment authorization, and status changes, reported by universities and employers. Dear Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI strongly oppose the proposed regulation that would replace the current \"duration of status\" (D/S) policy for F-1 student and J-1 exchange visitor visas with fixed admission periods of two or four years, requiring extensions via Form I-539. I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” with fixed admission periods for foreign students. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and preserve America’s long-standing commitment to being the destination of choice for international education and exchange. This change would create significant harm to U.S. higher education, local economies, and America’s global competitiveness, while offering little to no real benefit in terms of national security or oversight. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and explore less disruptive alternatives, such as enhanced monitoring through SEVIS or targeted audits for high-risk cases. International students and exchange visitors are already subject to strict reporting requirements through SEVIS, and their continued lawful presence depends on maintaining their program of study or exchange.\nRather than enhancing national security— the stated goal—the rule risks undermining America's global competitiveness in higher education without clear evidence that the current D/S system is flawed beyond repair. This will harm U.S. universities, weaken research programs, and damage our reputation as the top destination for global education. The current system provides accountability while also giving students and schools the stability they need to plan long-term academic and research programs. Currently, processing times for Form I-539 applications, including those for extensions or changes of nonimmigrant status for F-1 and J-1 holders, average 9-15 months or longer in many cases. Requiring them to pay these fees every two to four years, especially for longer programs like PhDs that can span 5-7 years, creates an undue hardship and could deter talented individuals from pursuing education in the U.S. The filing fee for Form I-539 is currently $470, and while biometrics fees are now included, additional expenses such as legal assistance or premium processing (which costs up to $1,965 for a 30-day turnaround) could easily push the total cost toward $800 or more per application. International students contribute billions of dollars annually to the American economy, pay full tuition (often at higher rates than U.S. students), and are not eligible for federal financial aid. Introducing mandatory extensions for potentially hundreds of thousands of additional applicants annually—estimates from similar past proposals suggest over 300,000 extra filings—would exacerbate these delays, leading to even longer wait times and inefficiencies. International students contribute over $44 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support hundreds of thousands of jobs. I strongly oppose the proposed rule published by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on August 28, 2025, which eliminates the \"duration of status\" (D/S) framework for F (academic students), J (exchange visitors), and I (foreign media representatives) nonimmigrants, replacing it with fixed admission periods, mandatory extensions of stay (EOS), and restrictive measures. Public Comment Opposing ICEB–2025–0001\n\nTo Whom It May Concern at the Department of Homeland Security,\n\nAs an engineer working at Google, and more broadly as a professional deeply engaged in the U.S. technology ecosystem, I write with great concern regarding the Department’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ICEB–2025–0001, which seeks to replace “Duration of Status (D/S)” with a fixed admission period for F, J, and I visa holders. For these reasons, I respectfully but strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this proposed rule. By imposing a fixed admission period—requiring repeated extensions of stay—you risk creating an environment of uncertainty and anxiety for international students and scholars. By discouraging international students and scholars from choosing the U.S., we risk a future where the next breakthrough technology—the equivalent of Google Search, self-driving cars, or generative AI—is developed and commercialized elsewhere. This uncertainty will inevitably push top global talent to Canada, Europe, or Asia, where competing governments are actively making their immigration systems friendlier. Threat to U.S. Economic Competitiveness\n\nAccording to NAFSA, international students contributed over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy before the pandemic, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs. Harm to U.S. Educational Competitiveness and Economy\nInternational students contribute $43.8 billion annually, supporting 378,175 jobs (NAFSA, 2023-2024). Universities lose unsubsidized international tuition subsidizing domestic programs; economy loses STEM talent (50% of F-1s in science/engineering). Impact on America’s Innovation Pipeline\n\nThe United States has long led the world in science, engineering, and technology because we have consistently attracted the best and brightest talent. The 4-year cap (shorter for some) and 30-day grace period (from 60 days for F-1s) create uncertainty, deterring enrollment. But from a security standpoint, pushing the world’s best minds to study and work in China, Europe, or the Middle East weakens America’s position. Replacing D/S with fixed admission periods will not meaningfully reduce fraud, but it will significantly reduce America’s ability to attract talent critical for maintaining technological supremacy. Evidence from the Center for Immigration Studies and GAO reports notes some F-1 fraud, but SEVIS already tracks compliance in real-time. However, SEVIS mandates real-time reporting; DHS conducts visits/reviews (8 CFR 214.3(h)). Dear Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI urge DHS to reconsider the proposals in ICEB-2025-0001 that would (1) limit students from pursuing multiple master’s degrees and (2) replace “duration of status” with fixed admission periods. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) recently proposed rule to establish a fixed time period of admission for nonimmigrant academic students (F-visas), exchange visitors (J-visas), and representatives of foreign information media is a policy with profoundly negative consequences. A fixed four-year admission period would force these students to file multiple USCIS extensions—slowing down research and creating unnecessary stress. This would not only create immense uncertainty for international students and scholars but also undermine the United States' leadership in global education, innovation, and economics. Faced with an environment of uncertainty and the risk of having their studies interrupted, many talented international students may opt for more welcoming countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, or Australia. International students and scholars bring immense economic and cultural value to the United States. Conclusion\n\nRestricting multiple master’s degrees and eliminating duration of status will not solve the core issues of compliance but will damage America’s reputation as the world’s leader in higher education. Students Should Be Allowed to Pursue Multiple Master’s Degrees\n\nAcademic and professional journeys often require more than one advanced degree. Rather than an outright ban, DHS could adopt reasonable limits, such as requiring the second master’s to be in a distinct field or capping the total number of years in student status. The \"duration of status\" system was not created arbitrarily; it provides international students and scholars with the necessary flexibility to navigate real-world situations. We urge DHS to reconsider this rule and recognize the value of the \"duration of status\" system. Adding tens of thousands of student extension requests would overwhelm the system further, creating risks of gaps in legal status for innocent students. Maintaining this flexible and effective system is essential to ensuring the prosperity of U.S. higher education and continuing to attract the world's brightest minds. Both changes would harm America’s long-term interests in education, innovation, and global competitiveness. These adjustments would protect national interests while keeping the U.S. an attractive destination for the world’s brightest minds. Comment Opposing Proposed Rule: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\n\nExecutive Summary\nAs a current international student pursuing a second master’s degree in the United States, I write to strongly oppose DHS’s proposal to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I visa holders (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 83, §214.2). Statement Opposing the DHS Proposal to Eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F-1/J-1 Students\nAs a former international student, I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposal to replace Duration of Status (D/S) with a fixed maximum stay of four years for F-1/J-1 visa holders. - Employers may hesitate to hire candidates whose work authorization could be disrupted by visa re-adjudications outside their control. The proposed prohibition on graduate students changing programs (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 97, §214.2(f)(5)(ii)) particularly harms those pursuing interdisciplinary careers—like mine—that evolve across fields. Restricting stays to rigid timeframes and limiting academic mobility (e.g., prohibiting graduate-level program changes, Proposed Rule PDF, p. 97, §214.2(f)(5)(ii)) sends a message that the U.S. is no longer welcoming. Talent Drain and Red Tape\nRequiring frequent extension applications and restricting program flexibility adds bureaucracy without clear gains. This change would impose unnecessary risk, uncertainty, and administrative burden on students and institutions, while undermining the United States’ global leadership in higher education and research. This red tape will drive talented students and researchers toward Canada, the UK, and Australia—countries already competing aggressively for global talent. My own academic path—switching fields between undergraduate and graduate studies, and now pursuing a second master’s in project management—illustrates why flexibility in academic choices is central to the U.S.’s global reputation. - International students contribute billions to the U.S. economy, support local communities, and strengthen the higher-education ecosystem. Harm to U.S. competitiveness\n  - Competing destinations (Canada, the UK, Australia, EU) are simplifying pathways for international students and graduates. - Students in long or specialized programs (e.g., PhD, dual degrees, fieldwork-heavy programs) often need more than four years; forcing renewals mid-study jeopardizes academic continuity. A better path forward\n- Preserve Duration of Status (D/S) with strong compliance: Continue using D/S while improving SEVIS reporting, institutional oversight, and targeted enforcement against bad actors. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead strengthen oversight without undermining the D/S framework. - Schools’ Designated School Officials (DSOs) will shoulder additional compliance tasks, diverting attention from student support and academic advising.\nDear Department of Homeland Security,\n\nAs an international student who is currently preparing to pursue graduate study in the United States, I respectfully submit my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the current “Duration of Status (D/S)” framework with a fixed period of admission and annual extension requirements for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with a fixed period of admission. Imposing a fixed period of admission and requiring annual extensions will create immense academic uncertainty, discouraging both students and faculty from pursuing ambitious or innovative research projects. While I understand the stated goal of improving program oversight, this proposal is a deeply flawed solution that will create significant, unnecessary harm to the U.S. economy, impose unmanageable administrative burdens on students and institutions, and fundamentally misunderstands the structure of American graduate education. Unmanageable Administrative Burdens and Costs\nThe proposed rule would create a bureaucratic nightmare for students, universities, and USCIS itself. The proposed changes would undermine our country's standing as a global leader in education and innovation, create massive and unnecessary administrative burdens, and impose hardship on students for no compelling reason. Equity and Fairness Concerns\nThe rule could disproportionately impact students from certain countries, disciplines (such as STEM, where PhDs routinely exceed 5-6 years), or those facing unexpected circumstances such as health crises, visa processing delays, or global emergencies. Alternative Approaches\nThe United States already has strong oversight systems in place, such as SEVIS, regular reporting by Designated School Officials, and periodic checks for employment authorization (OPT/CPT). While many bachelor's programs last four years, a doctoral degree in the United States routinely requires five to seven years of intensive research and study. Increased Administrative and Psychological Burden\nAnnual extension applications would force thousands of students and schools to dedicate significant time and resources to paperwork, documentation, and legal consultation—resources that could be better spent on research, learning, and personal growth. For Universities: Designated School Officials (DSOs), who are already tasked with significant responsibilities, will be overwhelmed with advising countless students on a complex new process, thereby increasing institutional costs. For Students: The EOS process is not a simple check-in; it is a time-consuming and anxiety-inducing application that distracts students from their primary purpose: their education and research. A Fundamental Misalignment with Academic Realities\nThe proposal’s premise of a two- or four-year admission period demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of American higher education, particularly at the graduate level. Academic Disruption and Uncertainty\nThe United States’ higher education system is globally renowned for its academic rigor and flexibility, especially for graduate and doctoral students. I urge DHS to reconsider this proposal and maintain the current D/S framework, which has supported decades of U.S. educational excellence and international leadership. Faced with the uncertainty and bureaucratic nightmare of fixed admission periods, top international students, scholars, and researchers—particularly those in long-term Ph.D. or research programs—will choose to study and work in competitor nations with more stable and welcoming immigration frameworks. To the Department of Homeland Security, Docket Clerk:\n\nI am writing as a concerned American citizen from Arkansas with a background in economics and national security to formally oppose the proposed rule (Docket DHS-2025-0250-0001) that would replace Duration of Status (D/S) with a fixed-term visa system for F-1 and J-1 students. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was specifically created to monitor foreign students and protect national security. It is an arbitrary and capricious policy that will inflict immense and irreparable harm on the U.S. academic system, scientific research, and the free press, while undermining this nation's standing as a global leader in education and innovation. The United States' position as a global leader is built on its ability to attract the world's brightest minds. This policy is a grave strategic error that will weaken the United States, harm our economy, and undermine our long-term competitiveness. This proposed rule would be a profound act of self-sabotage, creating a new layer of red tape and uncertainty that will push these critical students and researchers away, directly benefiting our competitors. Our existing D/S system, coupled with robust tracking through the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), is an effective and pragmatic approach to student oversight. The proposed rule replaces this predictable standard with a high-stakes, discretionary adjudication process for an Extension of Stay (EOS) with USCIS. The agency's own economic analysis projects the rule's costs to be hundreds of millions of dollars annually, placing an enormous financial burden on students, researchers, journalists, and their sponsoring institutions. This new process involves significant costs, mandatory biometrics collection, and long, unpredictable processing times. To justify this drastic change, the agency points to isolated, anecdotal cases of fraud and a small number of long-term students. It will create chaos for millions of law-abiding individuals and the American institutions that host them, all while providing no meaningful security benefit that could not be achieved through existing enforcement mechanisms. Subjecting compliant individuals to such dire risk based on USCIS processing times is a flagrant violation of procedural due process. By making our process more cumbersome, we are essentially ceding our competitive advantage and pushing highly-skilled individuals—the very people who can start companies, create jobs, and innovate—directly into the arms of our competitors. Dear USCIS and DHS,\n\nI strongly oppose the proposed rule ICEB-2025-0001 because it would significantly disrupt international education in the United States, impose unnecessary administrative burdens on both students and the government, and undermine the country’s long-standing ability to attract global talent. Risk of global talent flight\n\nCountries such as Canada, the U.K., and Australia are actively recruiting international students with more welcoming immigration policies. Other countries—including Canada, the U.K., and Australia—actively streamline visa processes for advanced degree students because they recognize the economic and scientific value of retaining global talent. Administrative Burden and Ineffective Policy Design\n\nBy requiring international students to file I-539 extensions after only a few years, this rule will immediately create hundreds of thousands of additional cases for USCIS every year. I write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the existing “duration of status (D/S)” framework with a fixed four-year admission cap and mandatory USCIS extension procedures. It ties immigration status directly to academic standing, as monitored by Designated School Officials and SEVIS reporting, without forcing every student through repetitive USCIS adjudications. Administrative backlogs and costs\n\nForcing hundreds of thousands of students to file USCIS extensions will overwhelm an agency that already struggles with processing delays. Given the agency’s existing backlog and processing delays, adding this volume of routine, non-discretionary applications will almost certainly slow down adjudications for other applicants, including work visas and family petitions. Students might face gaps in employment authorization or forced interruptions in training due to USCIS processing delays. Reduced academic flexibility\n\nGraduate students often change advisors, switch research directions, or add degrees (for example, pursuing a master’s en route to the Ph.D.). I urge DHS and USCIS to withdraw or substantially revise the proposal to:\n\nReduce administrative burdens rather than increase them\n\nAlign visa durations with realistic academic timelines\n\nPreserve academic and professional flexibility for students Shortened grace periods and program-change restrictions\n\nThe proposal reduces grace periods and limits the ability to change programs or institutions without filing extensions. A four-year limit forces almost all doctoral students to interrupt their research in order to file extensions, creating unnecessary administrative burdens and jeopardizing time-sensitive research projects. Fixed four-year expiration dates could disrupt projects midway, harming not only students but also federally funded research and university-industry collaborations. These backlogs will create legal limbo for students, undermine research timelines, and generate unnecessary costs for both students and institutions. I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F (academic student), J (exchange visitor), and I (foreign media) visa categories and replace it with a fixed admission period. I respectfully oppose DHS’s proposal to replace “Duration of Status (D/S)” with fixed admission periods for F-1 academic students, J-1 exchange visitors, and I-visa representatives of foreign information media. The Rule Encourages Overstay Due to Delays, Not Prevents It\nA. Counterintuitive Effects\nThe proposed rule is intended to curb visa overstays, yet it creates the very conditions that increase them:\n     Processing delays → visa expiration before renewal decision → inadvertent unlawful presence\nUnder D/S, students are considered in-status as long as they meet program terms. I urge DHS to withdraw the proposal and preserve D/S, or at a minimum adopt automatic alignment with school-approved extensions and targeted, risk-based oversight in place of universal re-admission hurdles. Increased Cost and Bureaucracy for U.S. Institutions\nUniversities and program sponsors will face new administrative burdens to track, support, and document student compliance and assist with time-consuming extension processes. Under fixed terms, these ordinary delays would force people who are fully compliant to file mid-program extensions—often right in the middle of exams, deadlines, or travel for research. Maintaining D/S while strengthening risk-based SEVIS audits, requiring timely DSO attestations for program extensions, and improving interagency data matching would focus scrutiny where problems actually arise without imposing new filings on compliant participants. The Current System (D/S) Works and Has Compliance Checks\nSEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) already tracks compliance in real-time.\nSchools and sponsors must report status violations—no need for arbitrary fixed end dates. Surge in Extension and Reinstatement Petitions\nUnder the current D/S model, visa holders only need to maintain compliance without repetitive paperwork. Impact on Healthcare and Research\nJ visa holders include foreign medical graduates in residency programs, especially in rural and underserved areas. Unintended Criminalization\nFixed terms without flexibility risk turning compliant visa holders into “overstayers” overnight due to paperwork or delays—not misconduct. Clear service-level guarantees for processing times should be published and met so graduation dates, start dates, and reporting assignments are not jeopardized. As of 2025, USCIS processing times for I-539 range from 4–15 months depending on the service center—this will only get worse. Such proposals—whether they take the form of restricting students from certain countries, curtailing talent in critical STEM fields, or cutting post-graduation practical training opportunities (OPT)—are not only a cruel blow to the thousands of young individuals pursuing their dreams but also a severe detriment to America's own economic vitality, technological leadership, and global soft power. International student offices (such as the Office of International Students and Scholars at Tufts University) would also face increased administrative pressure, diverting resources away from supporting students’ academic and cultural integration. Second, restricting international students would directly undermine America's leadership position in global science and technology. To the esteemed policymakers and all who are concerned about the future of the United States:\nI am writing today to express my most resolute opposition to any and all proposals aimed at tightening policies for international students (F1 visa holders). Furthermore, the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program does not take jobs from Americans; rather, it provides U.S. companies with invaluable access to top global talent, filling critical skills gaps in fields like technology, engineering, and healthcare. I urge policymakers to look to the future, reject these shortsighted policies based on misunderstanding and xenophobia, and continue to uphold America's image as a beacon of openness and confidence that embraces global talent. Maintaining Duration of Status is critical for protecting the stability of international students’ education, supporting U.S. universities, and preserving America’s reputation as a world leader in higher education. This proposed change would have significant negative consequences for international students like myself, as well as for U.S. higher education institutions and the nation’s ability to remain a leader in global education. Negative Impact on U.S. Competitiveness\n\nThe United States has long been a top destination for higher education because of its welcoming policies for international students, including the flexibility provided by D/S. Another option is to allow a longer maximum admission period (such as six years) to reflect the realities of academic programs, while still requiring schools to report on student progress annually. I strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) and replace it with a fixed four-year maximum admission period. Academic Impact\n\nMany academic programs, especially in research-intensive fields, extend beyond four years. Alternatives and Recommendations\n\nIf DHS is concerned about program integrity, a better solution would be to strengthen oversight mechanisms within SEVIS and maintain D/S, rather than imposing a rigid time cap. The correct approach is to optimize and strengthen existing screening mechanisms, not to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\" by using a sledgehammer for a problem that requires a scalpel. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing to provide comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media (Federal Register, Vol. (1) Introduction\nAs an individual who has worked and studied within academic communities in the United States, I am deeply concerned about the proposed rule establishing a fixed time of admission for nonimmigrant academic students. Recommendation: Permit F-1 students to pursue additional degrees at the same or lower level if they demonstrate academic intent and sufficient funding, with appropriate SEVIS and DSO oversight. OPT to PhD Transition and Risk of Status Gaps\n\nCurrently, under D/S, students on OPT can smoothly transition to a PhD program by obtaining a new I-20 from a SEVP-certified institution. Recommendation: Clarify that students transitioning from OPT to higher-level academic study will be considered to maintain status upon issuance of a new I-20 by a SEVP-certified institution, even if their EOS application is pending. Recommendation: Allow PhD and other long-term academic programs to be admitted for the normal duration of the program as indicated on Form I-20, without an arbitrary four-year cap, provided the student continues to make normal academic progress. While I understand the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) intent to enhance oversight and national security, I respectfully submit that several provisions—particularly as applied to F-1 academic students—pose significant and unnecessary burdens on international education and the U.S. higher education system. •\tAdministrative Burden on DHS and Universities: The rule will dramatically increase the number of extension applications submitted to USCIS, creating delays and higher costs. This creates unnecessary administrative burden for USCIS, increases costs for students, and introduces uncertainty into long-term research. Recommendation: DHS should weigh the relatively small security benefits against the significant economic and reputational costs to U.S. higher education and make adjustments that preserve program integrity without undermining competitiveness. This impact is especially severe at institutions where international graduate students make up a large share of enrollment, as their tuition often helps subsidize financial aid for domestic students, supports faculty research, and sustains academic programs. (3) Analysis\nThe proposed rule would have several negative consequences:\n•\tAcademic and Research Disruption: Many degree programs, particularly Ph.D. and other advanced research tracks, often take longer than four years to complete due to the unpredictable nature of research. Fixed time limits create uncertainty and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, disrupting both individual academic progress and the broader research ecosystem. (5) Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed elimination of “duration of status” and replacement with fixed time limits for F, J, and I visa holders will weaken the U.S. academically, economically, and culturally. Withdraw the proposed rule and preserve the current “duration of status” framework. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing to provide comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media (Federal Register, Vol. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing in response to the proposed rule, Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media (Federal Register, Aug. 28, 2025). Imposing a rigid four-year cap and restricting academic flexibility would push students toward countries with clearer, more welcoming visa systems. Recommendation: Clarify that students transitioning from OPT to higher-level academic study will be considered to maintain status upon issuance of a new I-20 by a SEVP-certified institution, even if their EOS application is pending. OPT to PhD Transition and Risk of Status Gaps\n\nCurrently, under D/S, students on OPT can smoothly transition to a PhD program by obtaining a new I-20 from a SEVP-certified institution. Restrictions on Educational Pathways (OPT → Graduate Programs)\n\nThe proposed rule prohibits F-1 students at the graduate level from changing programs during study and bars students from beginning a new program at the same or a lower educational level. Recommendation: Allow PhD and other long-term academic programs to be admitted for the normal duration of the program as indicated on Form I-20, without an arbitrary four-year cap, provided the student continues to make normal academic progress. Four-Year Limit and PhD Programs\n\nMany doctoral programs in the United States, particularly in STEM fields, require five to seven years to complete. I urge DHS to reconsider these provisions and seek a balanced approach that safeguards security while preserving the United States’ vital role as the premier destination for international education and research. While I understand the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) intent to enhance oversight and national security, I respectfully submit that several provisions—particularly as applied to F-1 academic students—pose significant and unnecessary burdens on international education and the U.S. higher education system. Recommendation: DHS should weigh the relatively small security benefits against the significant economic and reputational costs to U.S. higher education and make adjustments that preserve program integrity without undermining competitiveness. These costs will reduce the attractiveness of U.S. higher education compared to other countries such as Canada, the UK, and Australia, which are actively competing for international talent with simpler visa regimes. This creates unnecessary administrative burden for USCIS, increases costs for students, and introduces uncertainty into long-term research. Conclusion\n\nThe U.S. has long benefited from welcoming the world’s most talented students, many of whom contribute to American innovation, research, and economic growth. Administrative and Economic Costs\n\nDHS’s own analysis estimates annualized costs of approximately $390 million over ten years for students, schools, and the government. Specifically, the provisions to prohibit pursuing an equivalent degree, replace duration of status (D/S) with fixed admission periods, and reduce the post-completion grace period threaten the ability of international students to complete their education, participate in OPT, and contribute to the U.S. economy. Reduce the post-completion grace period from 60 to 30 days. The proposed changes undermine these goals:\n\nA 30-day grace period leaves insufficient time for job searches or visa transitions.\nICEB-2025-0001\n\nI am writing to respectfully oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) proposed rule, “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (Docket No. Replacing D/S with Fixed Admission\n\nThe current D/S framework ties lawful stay directly to compliance, monitored through SEVIS. •\tReplacing D/S with fixed admission periods would lead to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary extension requests, straining USCIS’s already overburdened system. Economic Impact and Soft Power Considerations\n\nInternational students and exchange visitors make significant contributions to the U.S. economy and diplomacy:\n\t•\tAccording to the Department of Commerce, these populations contribute over $40 billion annually to the economy and support hundreds of thousands of jobs. While DHS’s stated goals include enhancing oversight and program integrity, this proposal would undermine U.S. higher education, create unnecessary administrative obstacles, and weaken America’s ability to attract global talent. ⸻\n\nConclusion:\nThis proposed rule would create unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, undermine higher education and research leadership, and harm U.S. economic and diplomatic interests while providing minimal additional security. Higher Education: In STEM graduate programs, international students often represent more than half of total enrollment; in fields like electrical engineering and computer science, over 70 percent are international. Detrimental Effects on U.S. Education and Research\n\nThis proposal would seriously harm U.S. universities and research institutions:\n\t•\tInternational students and scholars play a critical role in STEM fields, graduate programs, and federally funded research. Like many students, I came to the United States because of its reputation for academic excellence, innovation, and the opportunities offered through programs such as Optional Practical Training (OPT). Overview of the Proposed Rule\n\nFor decades, F, J, and I nonimmigrants have been admitted for “duration of status,” meaning lawful stay was tied to compliance with academic or program requirements. Limited Security Benefits\n\nThe proposed change offers little security improvement compared to existing systems:\n\t•\tSEVIS already provides detailed, real-time data on student and exchange visitor status, with mandatory reporting of violations. The proposed rule published on August 28, 2025 (ICEB–2025–0001) would directly impact me and thousands of other students. Dear Members of the Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI write today as a patriotic American with a background in economics and national security, deeply concerned by the proposed DHS rule to eliminate “Duration-of-Status” (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 visa holders in favor of fixed admission periods not to exceed four years, followed by a mandatory extension process. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule, \"Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.\" While I appreciate the Department’s goal of improving oversight and safeguarding national security, this policy shift poses serious strategic, economic, and innovation-related risks—undermining American competitiveness. As a recent international graduate who has just begun my career in the United States, this policy introduces a level of uncertainty and bureaucratic burden that threatens not only my future but also America's ability to attract and retain global talent. Innovation and Economic Strength\nThe rationale for this rule overlooks the profound contributions international students and graduates make to the U.S. We are not just temporary visitors; we are integral to the nation's innovation and economic vitality. I implore you to withdraw this proposed rule and work with stakeholders to find a solution that secures borders while fostering the immense benefits that international students and professionals bring to this nation. The world's brightest students and professionals will choose other countries—like Canada, the UK, or Australia—that offer more stable and straightforward immigration pathways. Countries such as Canada, the UK, and Australia actively market themselves as science- and innovation-friendly alternatives—with clearer visa pathways and generous post-study work options. Curtailing the flexibility of D/S will erode America’s STEM advantage, inadvertently strengthening geopolitical competitors such as China, the UK, Canada, and Australia, who are actively welcoming global talent. Talent Drain: Red Tape Pushes Global Talent to Other Countries\n\nRigid maximum stays and extension processes are bureaucratic barriers that drive researchers and students away. I urge DHS to reject this proposal in its current form and instead invest in maintaining America’s competitive edge. Forcing students to apply for a complex and costly Extension of Stay (EOS) midway through their critical research is an unnecessary distraction that creates immense stress. NAFSA and JB International estimate that a 15 percent drop in enrollment could cost the U.S. economy nearly $7 billion and eliminate over 60,000 jobs. In the 2022–2023 academic year alone, they contributed well over $40 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 368,000 jobs across campuses, housing, retail, transportation, and services. Introducing fixed terms and added bureaucratic burden risks steep declines in international enrollment. While I recognize the intent to strengthen oversight, this proposal risks causing significant harm to the United States’ economic competitiveness, national security interests, and global leadership in education and research. By discouraging international students and exchange visitors, it weakens our research enterprise, reduces our global competitiveness, and erodes the diplomatic and cultural connections that serve U.S. security. At a time when the United States faces growing competition on the global stage, we should be doubling down on policies that attract and retain international talent, not creating new barriers that drive them away. Negative Long-Term Consequences for the United States\nThe proposed rule risks setting in motion a long-term decline in America’s ability to attract top international talent. For these reasons, I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead work with universities, employers, and security experts to strengthen oversight in ways that enhance — rather than undermine — America’s long-term national interests. In the long term, this diminishes U.S. soft power and influence, while strengthening competitors’ ability to attract global allies and leaders. Opposition to Proposed Rule on Fixed Admission and Restrictions on Educational Progression for F-1 Students\n\nExecutive Summary\nI respectfully oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule (DHS Docket No. I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing a fixed time period of admission and new extension procedures for nonimmigrant academic students, exchange visitors, and representatives of foreign information media. Administrative Burdens from Removing “Duration of Status” (D/S)\nEliminating D/S (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 31, Executive Summary) adds further harm. Imposing fixed admission periods with added uncertainty about extensions will make the U.S. less attractive compared to competitor nations such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, which provide clearer, more stable pathways for international study. Students and scholars who choose Canada, Europe, or Asia instead will build careers, companies, and discoveries there, rather than in the United States. Talented scholars will choose Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, the U.K., Australia, and others. It disregards real academic and career development, undermines U.S. higher education, and damages national interests. Pursuing a second master’s degree—or shifting from one advanced program to another—is a normal part of academic and career development. Respectfully submitted,\nAn incoming MS student in Computer Science in the United States planning to pursue an MBA for career advancement ICEB-2025-0001\n\nDear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing to provide comments on the proposed rule entitled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (DHS Docket No. While I acknowledge DHS’s stated objective of increasing oversight and ensuring accountability, I respectfully submit that the proposed rule is disproportionate, administratively burdensome, and misaligned with the realities of U.S. higher education and research. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. As a specialist in global talent mobility and workforce development, I am particularly concerned about the rule's failure to account for critical gaps in USCIS processing capacity and its devastating impact on America's position in the international competition for skilled professionals. The proposed rule fails both immediate policy objectives and long-term strategic interests, and should be withdrawn in favor of evidence-based alternatives that strengthen rather than weaken America's position as the world's premier destination for international talent. These nations are systematically targeting the same high-skilled populations that drive American innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology sectors critical to national competitiveness. Specifically, establish enhanced SEVIS reporting requirements for programs exceeding standard completion timelines, create fast-track extension processes for students in good academic standing, and develop bilateral agreements with key partner nations to streamline information sharing. Evidence-based Policy: The proposal cites abuse in abstract terms but provides no comprehensive data showing systemic misuse of D/S. However, the existing SEVIS system already provides real-time oversight by requiring schools to report enrollment, transfers, and completion. I recommend DHS implement targeted compliance measures that preserve the efficiency of duration of status while addressing legitimate oversight concerns. For these reasons, I urge DHS to reconsider this rule and preserve the duration-of-status framework, while addressing abuse through targeted enforcement rather than sweeping structural change. Conclusion\n\nWhile DHS’s desire for clarity and consistency is understandable, the proposed rule sacrifices flexibility, fairness, and U.S. competitiveness in pursuit of rigid enforcement. Canada's Provincial Nominee Program has reduced processing times to 6 months while expanding pathways to permanent residence.\nMoreover, shifting oversight to USCIS will overwhelm an agency already facing severe backlogs, likely resulting in processing delays and inadvertent lapses of lawful status for compliant students. Adding a USCIS extension-of-stay (EOS) requirement creates duplicative bureaucracy without measurable gains in compliance. To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI respectfully submit the following comments regarding the DHS proposed rule published on August 28, 2025, which seeks to replace “Duration of Status” (D/S) with fixed periods of admission, shorten the F-1 post-completion grace period from 60 days to 30 days, limit subsequent study to higher levels only, and introduce other significant changes. Agencies must provide reasoned explanations for regulatory changes and cannot adopt measures that are “arbitrary and capricious.” By failing to account for the realities of doctoral program timelines, the professional need for interdisciplinary study, and the practical difficulties of a 30-day grace period, the proposal risks being invalid under APA standards. The proposed rule to cap English language program admissions at 24 months (plus a shortened 30-day grace period) creates unnecessary barriers and undermines US educational competitiveness. The proposed time limits would have far-reaching negative effects: truncating educational pathways, undermining the international student pipeline, disadvantaging underrepresented learners, taking away from our economy, and weakening our country's global position in education. Cutting off eligibility at 24 months forces students to either leave before reaching readiness or to incur expensive, time-consuming re-entry processes — both of which risk derailing their US study plans and reducing enrollments downstream in degree programs, resulting in negative economic impact on those institutions and reducing employment opportunities for US natives. Many English language learners enroll in successive, tiered programs that take more than two years to achieve full proficiency — particularly students beginning at lower levels or those who are in need of academic English preparation to qualify for degree programs. In addition, sudden implementation without adequate transition could implicate principles of procedural due process, as students and institutions have relied on the long-standing Duration of Status framework in planning multi-year educational programs. Maintaining flexibility for English language programs will protect institutional revenue, support diversity, and uphold the nation’s long-standing commitment to educational exchange and international cooperation. I strongly believe that maintaining flexibility for international students will better serve both the students and the United States. I urge DHS to preserve the current rules allowing students to remain in English language for the duration needed to complete their studies, subject to the already existing, normal DSO oversight and SEVIS reporting requirements. A 24-month limit means these students are least likely to complete the academic preparation needed for college entry, exacerbating inequities by favoring those who already have advanced English training. Targeting English language and high school students with hard caps is a blunt policy instrument that punishes the majority of students and institutions who comply with US law. Pursuing an MBA or Master’s in Finance would be a deliberate and necessary step, not “degree hopping.” Many lawyers in this field hold more than one master’s degree in relevant fields. He is also actively considering pursuing an MBA program to better understand business and management principles. A four-year cap would result in repeated extension requests, administrative inefficiencies, and would deter top research talent from choosing U.S. universities. Recommendation: Clarify that students transitioning from OPT to higher-level academic study will be considered to maintain status upon issuance of a new I-20 by a SEVP-certified institution, even if their EOS application is pending. Every bureaucratic hurdle pushes talent toward Canada, UK, Australia—where they'll create innovations competing against American interests rather than advancing them. Perverse Incentives\nImmigration cliffs don't accelerate research—they create anxiety impeding progress. Real Scenarios Show Failure\n\n5th-year PhD needing one semester must file I-539, risk status loss if delayed\nMaster's student finding better lab faces transfer restrictions killing OPT\nStudents traveling risk losing work to visa backlogs\nMultiply by thousands—that's the impact. OPT to PhD Transition and Risk of Status Gaps\n\nCurrently, under D/S, students on OPT can smoothly transition to a PhD program by obtaining a new I-20 from a SEVP-certified institution. Given that USCIS processing times can exceed several months, this creates a risk of status gaps or inadvertent unlawful presence if adjudications are delayed or denied. Recommendation: Allow PhD and other long-term academic programs to be admitted for the normal duration of the program as indicated on Form I-20, without an arbitrary four-year cap, provided the student continues to make normal academic progress. It punishes students who relied on established rules, ignores doctoral education realities, creates perverse incentives, sabotages OPT, and contradicts DHS's burden-reduction commitments. Restrictions on Educational Pathways (OPT → Graduate Programs)\n\nThe proposed rule prohibits F-1 students at the graduate level from changing programs during study and bars students from beginning a new program at the same or a lower educational level. Better Alternative\n\nMaintain D/S and 60-day grace\nTarget bad actors with SEVIS analytics\nStreamline OPT, reduce pitfalls\nCoordinate with State on visa capacity\nThese address integrity without massive filing burdens. Reduction of Grace Period from 60 to 30 Days\n\nThe NPRM proposes to shorten the grace period after completion of study or OPT from 60 days to 30 days. Imposing a maximum four-year admission period will force nearly all PhD students to apply for one or more Extensions of Stay (EOS). These costs will reduce the attractiveness of U.S. higher education compared to other countries such as Canada, the UK, and Australia, which are actively competing for international talent with simpler visa regimes. Recommendation: DHS should weigh the relatively small security benefits against the significant economic and reputational costs to U.S. higher education and make adjustments that preserve program integrity without undermining competitiveness. While I understand the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) intent to enhance oversight and national security, I respectfully submit that several provisions—particularly as applied to F-1 academic students—pose significant and unnecessary burdens on international education and the U.S. higher education system. While I fully understand and respect the government's legitimate interest in strengthening national security and improving oversight of nonimmigrant visa holders, I believe that, in its current form, this proposal may have unintended negative consequences for thousands of international students and scholars who are fully compliant with U.S. immigration law. A more nuanced, data-driven approach—one that balances national security with fairness and practicality—would better serve the interests of the United States and its academic institutions, while continuing to welcome those who come here in good faith to study, teach, and contribute. The vast majority of these individuals are law-abiding, contribute significantly to U.S. educational institutions, and do not pose a threat to national security. I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed rule that seeks to establish a fixed maximum period of admission for F, J, and I visa holders. ICEB-2025-0001, RIN 1653-AA95\nI am writing as a professor at a major American research university to express my strenuous opposition to the proposed rule that would eliminate \"duration of status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. In conclusion, I sincerely hope that the Department of Homeland Security will reconsider the blanket imposition of a fixed admission period for all F and J visa holders. Imposing a four-year limit would force nearly all international doctoral students to apply for an extension during their studies, which introduces unnecessary bureaucratic delays, financial costs, and uncertainty. Rather than imposing a blanket four-year (or in some cases, two-year) limit on the admission period for all students, it would be more effective to focus on identifying specific risk factors associated with potential visa misuse. Crippling Our Research and Ceding Our Advantage\nThe nature of advanced academic work, particularly at the doctoral and post-doctoral levels, is inherently unpredictable and cannot be neatly confined to a fixed four-year window. As an educator and scientist who has mentored dozens of international students over my career, I can state unequivocally that this rule, while perhaps well-intentioned, would be a catastrophic, self-inflicted wound to American academia, scientific innovation, and our nation's long-term economic and strategic competitiveness. For decades, the United States has been the undisputed global leader in higher education and research, attracting the world’s most brilliant minds to our institutions. For example, bilingual and multicultural professionals in psychology or social work are critical to providing effective services to immigrant or minority communities. A one-size-fits-all immigration policy could inadvertently limit the presence of such professionals and create downstream social challenges in education, healthcare, and community support systems. The current proposal applies sweeping restrictions to all academic students and exchange visitors—regardless of their individual compliance history or risk level. In many cases, students would need to leave the U.S. to renew their visas abroad, incurring travel expenses, disrupting research timelines, and potentially facing visa processing delays that impact their ability to return. The proposed rule creates unnecessary administrative burdens, risks repeated interruptions to my education, and undermines the very principles of opportunity, innovation, and exchange that the United States has long championed. This will negatively impact higher education institutions’ financial health, weaken U.S. economic competitiveness, and diminish our ability to attract global talent. While the stated intent is to improve compliance and oversight, the unintended consequences of this rule would be significant and harmful to U.S. higher education institutions, the national economy, and long-term talent retention. Impact on Innovation and the “American Dream”\nThe United States has long attracted global talent by offering a flexible system that allows students to pursue their fields of passion, change majors if necessary, and combine study with practical experience.\nBy imposing rigid timelines and additional administrative burdens, the elimination of D/S will reduce the pool of qualified graduates available to American employers. Eliminating D/S will have the unintended effect of deterring qualified, highly educated foreign students from enrolling in U.S. programs, pursuing advanced or multiple degrees, and contributing to the American workforce. DHS itself acknowledges that F-1 students may face program delays due to academic probation, suspension, or other reasons, and considers these “generally unacceptable” for extensions (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 123, 8 CFR 214.2(f)). Expand disability accommodations, allowing program extensions for medical or learning-related needs without penalty. Breaking this cycle undermines both learning and productivity. Impact on Highly Skilled Foreign Graduates\n\nForeign students with strong educational and technical backgrounds contribute directly to U.S. competitiveness. Many pursue interdisciplinary or sequential degrees—such as a Master’s in Statistics followed by a Master’s in Biology, or an advanced degree followed by a Ph.D.—to build expertise in areas critical to the life sciences, data analytics, and pharmaceutical industries. International graduates often help fill these gaps in industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, information technology, and advanced manufacturing. Executive Summary\n\nI respectfully oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposal to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Dear Secretary of Homeland Security and Rulemaking Officials,\n\nI respectfully submit this comment to urge reconsideration of the proposal to eliminate Duration-of-Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrants. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and retain the duration of status framework, with targeted improvements in oversight. However, replacing the current “maintenance of status” framework with a universal fixed period plus frequent, case-by-case extension filings will create substantial procedural burden and uncertainty that risks driving away the very talent and partners who strengthen the United States’ research, innovation, economy, and global information exchange. These adjustments would protect national interests and program integrity while preserving the openness and predictability that keep world-class talent and trusted media partners choosing the United States. Conclusion\n\nThe United States can achieve integrity and accountability without imposing universal, recurring procedural hurdles on compliant students, scholars, exchange visitors, and journalists. I respectfully urge DHS/ICE to withdraw or significantly revise the proposal to incorporate risk-based oversight, status-linked validity, conditional auto-extensions, and strong transparency and service standards. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and retain the “duration of status” framework, which has proven effective for decades while safeguarding both national security and America’s global competitiveness. Conclusion\nThis rule does not strike a balance between national security and America’s longstanding role as a global leader in higher education. When lawful presence hinges on timelines outside an individual’s control, academic milestones, research funding deliverables, internships, collaborations, and time-sensitive reporting can be derailed by delays that have nothing to do with bad faith. Increased Bureaucratic and Financial Burdens\nThe proposed shift from “duration of status” (D/S) to fixed-term admission would require students to repeatedly file for extensions with USCIS to continue their programs. International students and scholars must coordinate visas, funding, lab schedules, human-subject approvals, conferences, and internships; foreign media must meet breaking-news windows. When a school official/sponsor confirms ongoing, full-time study or program participation, extend admission automatically to the next natural milestone (end of term, academic year, appointment end date, or assignment window). Allow admission validity to track verified program participation (as recorded through SEVIS/SEVP or sponsor systems) while concentrating adjudicative resources on outlier or high-risk cases. Moving large cohorts of otherwise compliant students, scholars, and journalists into new adjudication queues will predictably increase processing volume, requests for evidence, and re-filings. • Time-sensitive lanes for academic deadlines, federally funded projects, and accredited media assignments where missed windows cause irreparable harm. The constant pressure to maintain legal status, combined with uncertainty about whether extensions will be approved, will worsen mental health burdens. Universities, labs, and companies will need to redesign calendars and projects around renewal windows, hold contingency resources, and limit participation for otherwise qualified individuals due to status uncertainty. Opposing Comment on ICEB-2025-0001: Fixed Time Period of Admission for Nonimmigrant Students and Exchange Visitors\n\nAs a policy analyst focused on international education and U.S. global influence, I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am an international student currently pursuing a graduate degree in the United States and would like to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule ICEB-2025-0001, which seeks to replace the current “Duration of Status (D/S)” system with fixed admission periods and mandatory extension processes. I urge DHS to reconsider this rule and prioritize policies that strengthen—not weaken—America’s global leadership in education and cultural exchange. The proposed rule threatens this balance:\n\nRigid Timelines: Imposing a four-year cap on admission, regardless of academic program length, introduces uncertainty and discourages long-term enrollment. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to improve immigration oversight, this rule risks undermining the United States’ strategic advantage in global education and eroding its soft power at a critical moment. It would make U.S. higher education less competitive, slow research output, and send a damaging signal to the global talent pipeline. Policies that deter enrollment, prolong uncertainty, or derail degree completion weaken research output and harm local economies that depend on these programs. Not all students can complete their programs within rigid timelines due to research setbacks, funding delays, health issues, or field-specific demands. Foreign-born talent makes up 19% of the STEM workforce and 43% of doctorate-level scientists and engineers nationwide. Countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia are actively courting international students with simpler, more predictable visa pathways that lead to work authorization or permanent residency. Doctoral programs, which average 5.8 years to completion (NSF, 2024), would require multiple extension filings, creating friction and anxiety for students. Some students pursue same-level graduate degrees (e.g., two master’s or two Ph.D.) to enhance their skill sets and align with evolving career goals. Even DHS’s own description acknowledges a fixed admission period up to four years plus a 30-day grace period, with extensions required for ordinary academic progress, OPT, or STEM OPT. If students choose these destinations instead, the U.S. will lose a pipeline of highly educated workers who often stay, start companies, or join cutting-edge industries after graduation. 4) Cutting the F-1 grace period to 30 days is counterproductive. A more balanced approach—issuing visas that reflect actual program durations, allowing flexibility in academic choice, and maintaining the existing 60-day grace period—will ensure that the United States continues to attract, retain, and benefit from the best global talent. Maintaining the 60-day grace period provides international graduates with a reasonable window to secure positions where their skills can directly benefit U.S. innovation, economic growth, and global leadership. Reduction of Grace Period After Graduation\nThe proposed reduction of the post-graduation grace period from 60 days to 30 days is similarly detrimental to U.S. competitiveness. DHS-2025-0250-0001\n\nAs a taxpayer and resident of Memphis, Tennessee, I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate Duration-of-Status (D/S) admissions for F, J, and I visa holders and replace them with fixed-term visas. By imposing rigid visa timelines and burdensome extension procedures, DHS risks deterring talented individuals from choosing U.S. institutions, thereby undermining local economic vitality. Duration of Stay for F/J Visa Holders\nThe proposed four-year limit on F and J visas fails to reflect the reality of U.S. doctoral education. Department of Education data shows that 59% of doctoral students in STEM fields require more than four years to complete their programs, with engineering and life sciences averaging 5.8 and 6.2 years respectively. Research timelines are often unpredictable, and forcing scholars to file for extensions mid-project introduces uncertainty and administrative delays that can jeopardize critical work—especially in fields like medicine, engineering, and climate science. Specifically, I recommend implementing automated compliance scoring through enhanced SEVIS analytics, establishing fast-track extension procedures for students at highly-ranked institutions with strong compliance records, and creating bilateral agreements with key partner countries for streamlined processes. For decades, these sectors have relied heavily on the contributions of international students and scholars who come to the United States with genuine dedication to advancing research, innovation, and knowledge. Conclusion\nTaken together, these proposed changes risk discouraging international students from choosing the United States as their destination for higher education and research. When Singapore, Canada, and the United Kingdom have streamlined their visa processes to attract international students, the United States is proposing to add friction precisely where competitors are removing it. The proposed policy change carries profound implications for the global leadership status of U.S. academia and the high-tech industry. This risks driving talent to competitor nations like Canada, the UK, and Australia—countries that are actively streamlining their immigration processes to attract global talent. Duration-of-Status is a proven, flexible, and effective framework that supports our educational institutions, strengthens our economy, and enhances our global leadership. Targeted enforcement against actual violators, not blanket restrictions on all students, is the most effective and fair way to preserve program integrity while maintaining the United States’ position as a global leader in education and research.\nThis rule, as drafted, would create unnecessary instability, stifle academic and professional growth, and ultimately undermine the United States' long-held position as the premier destination for global talent. A fixed-term admission, however, imposes an arbitrary deadline that is fundamentally incompatible with the realities of academic life.Graduate students, in particular, face unpredictable timelines. Designated School Officials (DSOs) at academic institutions are already responsible for diligently reporting student compliance, flagging any issues, and terminating the status of those who fall out of compliance.The existing D/S framework is not a system of unchecked leniency; it is a system of effective, continuous oversight. Imposing a fixed time limit duplicates existing oversight mechanisms and would do little to address fraud or abuse, which are better handled through targeted enforcement rather than blanket restrictions. While we recognize the stated intent of this proposal is to enhance program integrity and national security, we believe the unforeseen consequences would be profoundly detrimental to the very institutions and communities this country seeks to lead. This letter is submitted in strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the current \"duration of status\" (D/S) policy with a fixed term of admission for international students, exchange visitors, and media representatives. This additional workload would likely strain institutional budgets and could even lead to errors, inadvertently penalizing students who are in good standing.The proposed rule suggests a need for a fixed term to prevent students from overstaying their visas. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) provides real-time tracking of international students, their enrollment status, and any changes in their program. It ensures that nonimmigrants remain in the United States only while engaged in their authorized programs, with real-time monitoring through SEVIS and institutional reporting. DHS already receives continuous updates when students change programs, transfer institutions, or engage in authorized training. Students may change majors, transfer institutions, or undertake crucial internships that extend their time in the program. This is not merely an inconvenience; it represents a significant barrier to academic achievement and a disincentive for top students to pursue advanced degrees in the U.S.Furthermore, a fixed-term admission fails to account for the common and necessary changes that occur during a student's academic journey. The D/S system, by its very nature, provides the flexibility necessary for students to navigate the complexities of higher education. The D/S system simply allows for the necessary flexibility within a student's academic lifecycle, a flexibility that is essential for a high-quality education. Restricting this freedom sends a message of mistrust and limitation, undermining the image of the United States as the “Land of the Free.” In the long run, this shift risks weakening America’s soft power and diminishing its influence as a global leader in education and innovation. Restricting this system conveys mistrust and limitation, eroding the image of the United States as the “Land of the Free.” Such a shift would not only harm the U.S.’s soft power but also weaken its influence in global education, research, and cultural exchange. This rule, as drafted, would create unnecessary instability, stifle academic and professional growth, and ultimately undermine the United States' long-held position as the premier destination for global talent. Harm to America’s Global Reputation and Core Values\nPerhaps most concerning, eliminating the D/S model undermines the symbolic role of the United States as a beacon of freedom and opportunity. Beyond the practical impacts, eliminating D/S would also damage America’s symbolic role as a beacon of freedom and opportunity. Denying them this opportunity contradicts the principle of educational freedom and undermines the role of U.S. institutions in providing diverse and flexible learning pathways. The flexibility of D/S embodies academic freedom and openness, values that have long distinguished the U.S. as the premier destination for international students and scholars. The current system has proven effective in supporting academic integrity, fostering economic growth, reducing administrative burden, and advancing America’s leadership in education and innovation. The flexibility of D/S embodies academic freedom and openness, values that distinguish America from other nations. This letter is submitted in strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the current \"duration of status\" (D/S) policy with a fixed term of admission for international students, exchange visitors, and media representatives.

ICEB-2025-0001\nSubject: Opposition to Proposed Rule to Eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI am a current international Ph.D. student in the United States on an F-1 visa, writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F, J, and I visa holders and replacing it with a fixed admission period. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and retain the duration of status framework, with targeted improvements in oversight. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw the proposal and preserve the Duration of Status model, which balances oversight with the flexibility required for genuine academic and journalistic work. The proposed rule creates unnecessary administrative burdens, risks repeated interruptions to my education, and undermines the very principles of opportunity, innovation, and exchange that the United States has long championed. Impact on Innovation and the “American Dream”\nThe United States has long attracted global talent by offering a flexible system that allows students to pursue their fields of passion, change majors if necessary, and combine study with practical experience. Imposing a rigid four-year time limit will push students and scholars toward universities in Canada, the EU, and other countries offering more flexible systems. The proposed rule would restrict graduate students from changing programs once enrolled (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 121, 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(iii)), eliminating the ability to adjust academic paths—a critical part of the educational process. Imposing a rigid four-year cap with a mandatory USCIS extension process would introduce unnecessary stress, delays, and uncertainty, threatening the successful completion of advanced degrees. DHS itself acknowledges that F-1 students may face program delays due to academic probation, suspension, or other reasons, and considers these “generally unacceptable” for extensions (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 123, 8 CFR 214.2(f)). Forcing them into costly and uncertain extension processes creates unnecessary barriers that discourage enrollment and may cause institutions—particularly state universities and community colleges that rely on tuition revenue—to lose critical funding. By destabilizing their legal status with arbitrary deadlines, DHS risks creating uncertainty not just for them, but also for the communities and families who host and support them. The flexibility of D/S allows international students like myself to progress academically without interruption. Practical Alternatives\nRather than imposing blanket fixed terms, DHS should:\n\nRetain D/S while strengthening SEVIS reporting and compliance reviews. Instead of introducing rigid time limits, DHS should strengthen existing reporting mechanisms, improve fraud detection, and invest in compliance infrastructure that does not punish legitimate students and scholars. The current D/S system already ensures compliance through SEVIS reporting and university oversight. Introduction\nI am submitting this comment as an international scholar who is directly affected by the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (Docket No. Administrative Burden and Inefficiency\nForcing tens of thousands of students and exchange visitors to file extension or change of status applications will overwhelm USCIS, which already faces significant backlogs. Imposing a fixed time period of admission forces students to apply for extensions or change of status mid-program. Conclusion\nThis proposed rule will not improve security or efficiency—it will instead deter top global talent, weaken U.S. universities, harm local economies, and undermine our leadership in science and technology. By forcing mid-program status interruptions, DHS risks fragmenting the very talent pipelines that have historically fed America's innovation economy. The proposed fixed admission periods create what economists call \"pathway uncertainty costs\" that extend far beyond individual students to entire talent ecosystems. I have extensive academic and professional experience in U.S. higher education and therefore understand both the practical realities of long-term study and the statutory framework governing F-1, J-1, and H-1B programs. Conclusion\nThe proposed rule is inconsistent with statute, harmful to U.S. higher education, and unnecessarily burdensome to both DHS and the public. Graduate students frequently shift disciplines in response to research needs and career goals; restricting this undermines the flexibility and innovation that are hallmarks of U.S. higher education. It would deter talented students and researchers, weaken the global competitiveness of American universities, and create administrative backlogs without tangible security gains.\nAnalysis\n\nContrary to Congressional Intent:\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) authorizes students to remain for the duration of a full course of study (§101(a)(15)(F)) and does not mandate rigid year limits. Canada's International Student Program and Australia's Temporary Graduate visa demonstrate this principle: both countries have gained significant market share in international education precisely by offering timeline certainty that the U.S. has historically provided through D/S. Preserve existing OPT and STEM OPT structures, including cap-gap protection for H-1B applicants. It would also impose additional restrictions on F-1 students, including limitations on Optional Practical Training (OPT), barriers to the H-1B transition, and prohibitions on pursuing a second degree or changing academic level in certain circumstances. Infringement on Academic Freedom:\nThe rule’s prohibition on lateral degree changes or second-degree enrollment intrudes into academic decision-making, which is reserved for accredited institutions and the Department of Education. Under change in Changes in Educational Objectives, my grievance is with restrictions on enrollment on same level of education:\nEstablishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media\n\nDear Sir or Madam:\n\nI respectfully oppose the portion of this rule that prevents students from pursuing more than one degree at the same academic level. More balanced alternatives\nInstead of a blanket prohibition, I urge USCIS to consider:\n\nCaps or time limits: Allow up to three master’s degrees, or set a maximum time at the same level, addressing concerns about decade-long enrollment without banning it outright. The blanket prohibition on second master’s degrees or same-level program changes ignores these legitimate academic and professional needs. Harm to U.S. higher education and economy\nThe U.S. hosted over 1.1 million international students in 2023/24, including 502,000 graduate students, contributing $38–41 billion annually and supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide. From the perspective of U.S. national interests, the rule is counterproductive and risks harming higher education, research, and the economy. ⸻\n\nConclusion\n\nThis rule will impose heavy economic costs, overburden USCIS, deter top PhD talent, block reasonable academic pathways, and still fail to address the actual sources of abuse. I urge DHS to withdraw or substantially revise this proposal, focusing instead on targeted enforcement that protects program integrity while sustaining America’s global leadership in education and research. America’s global leadership in STEM research depends on attracting top doctoral talent, and this rule undermines that foundation. This approach balances integrity with the nation’s need for advanced, specialized talent in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and other key domains where USA would lag with such punitive changes. Misstated problem and existing safeguards\nDHS argues that fixed periods and enrollment limits are needed to prevent abuse, but international students are already monitored through SEVIS, which tracks program updates in real time. Workforce and national competitiveness impacts\nForeign-born students are critical to U.S. innovation: they make up 19% of all STEM workers and 43% of doctorate-level scientists and engineers. In terms of percentages these rules focus on a small % of cases and penalizes all the students for it where as these rules could be better tweaked to only address the stated concerns by looking at my proposals. Many of today’s fastest-growing fields (AI, cybersecurity, data science) require layered expertise that often spans multiple master’s degrees. A student with a business degree may wish to pursue computer science; a math graduate may seek applied finance; a PhD in science may later pursue law or an MBA. Universities design specialized master’s programs because demand exists from students who already hold one degree but seek to retrain or specialize further. https://www.nafsa.org/about/about-nafsa/international-students-contribute-record-breaking-level-spending-and-378000-jobs\nWhite House Council of Economic Advisers, AI Talent Report, Jan. 14, 2025. https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2025/01/14/ai-talent-report Reference:\nNAFSA: International Students Contribute Record-Breaking Level of Spending and 378,000 Jobs (2023-2024). For the 2023–2024 academic year, they contributed nearly $43 billion to U.S. GDP and supported 378,000 jobs nationwide (NAFSA/IIE). I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and instead focus on targeted, evidence-based measures that truly address fraud and abuse without inflicting broad harm on U.S. higher education and competitiveness. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based alternatives that strengthen oversight without undermining our foundational advantages in international education. Conclusion\nThis proposal would weaken the U.S. economy, overburden USCIS, discourage top international scholars, erode the pipeline for innovation in AI and other high-tech fields, and deny students the flexibility needed to meet modern career demands. Disruption of Graduate Education and Research\nThe NPRM limits F and J admissions to program length “not to exceed a 4-year period.” Doctoral study, especially in STEM fields, routinely exceeds this period. Forcing students to apply for multiple Extensions of Stay (EOS) mid-program will divert time from research, increase costs, and heighten the risk of status lapses. NCES data demonstrates that median time-to-degree for doctoral programs across STEM fields ranges from 5.8 to 7.2 years, with significant variation by discipline. LinkedIn's 2023 Global Talent Trends report indicates that 35% of successful tech professionals hold degrees in multiple disciplines at the same level, with combinations like computer science and business administration becoming standard career preparation. I respectfully oppose the proposed rule that would replace “duration of status” with fixed admission periods for F and J visa holders and restrict second degrees at the same level. As a U.S. faculty member, I strongly oppose DHS’s proposal to end “duration of status” (D/S) and impose fixed admission periods for F/J/I nonimmigrants, as well as to shorten the F-1 grace period. Adding mandatory EOS filings for thousands of students will strain Designated School Officials (DSOs), create compliance risks, and increase costs without clear security benefits. Given USCIS's current I-539 processing times averaging 10-13 months, this volume increase will create systematic backlogs affecting not only students but the entire family-based and employment immigration ecosystem. The proposed timeline would force approximately 60% of doctoral candidates into mid-program extension procedures, creating artificial disruption points that competitor nations actively avoid. Dear Department of Homeland Security Officials,\n\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would eliminate the duration of status (D/S) policy for F-1 students and replace it with fixed admission periods. The Proposed Rule Fundamentally Misunderstands PhD Education Timelines**\n\nThe proposed maximum 4-year fixed admission period is incompatible with the realities of doctoral education. Administrative Burden Would Harm Both Students and the System**\n\nNAFSA has noted that these changes will force students \"into a sea of administrative delays at best, and at worst, into unlawful presence status—leaving them vulnerable to punitive actions through no fault of their own.\" As an international PhD student pursuing research in computer architecture and electronic design automation, I believe this rule would create significant barriers to academic success and scientific advancement while failing to achieve its stated security objectives. Research shows that PhD students on average take 5.8 years to complete their programs. In computer architecture and EDA, where research often involves complex hardware design, fabrication delays, and iterative experimentation, completion times frequently extend beyond four years due to factors entirely beyond student control. This timeline mismatch would force the majority of PhD students to navigate multiple extension applications, creating uncertainty precisely when students need stability to focus on groundbreaking research that benefits U.S. technological competitiveness. The most harmful element is the prohibition on pursuing another degree at the same level or at a lower level after completing a higher one. That change eliminates the academic flexibility that international students need to re-skill, change fields, or correct early academic choices. The Rule Creates Discriminatory Treatment Based on Country of Origin**\n\nThe proposed rule would limit students from countries with visa overstay rates greater than 10% to just two-year periods, creating a discriminatory two-tiered system. This approach:\n\n- Punishes individual students for the statistical behavior of others from their country\n- Is unprecedented among other nonimmigrant classifications (B/H/L/O/P/E), none of which vary admission periods based on country overstay rates\n- Undermines the merit-based principles of academic admission by introducing nationality-based restrictions\n\n**III. The Rule Interferes with Academic Decision-Making**\n\nThe proposed restrictions on changing educational levels and the aggregate 24-month limit on language training represent unprecedented federal interference in academic program design. Universities and faculty are best positioned to determine appropriate educational pathways, not immigration enforcement agencies. That is not a narrow anti-abuse fix—it is a broad restriction on educational freedom that targets a single group based on immigration status. Competitor countries are leaning into that model with clearer, more flexible pathways. For universities, this change would impose significant administrative burdens on Designated School Officials, increase compliance costs, and likely lead to a decline in enrollment, as students may opt for study destinations with more predictable immigration pathways, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, or Australia. For these reasons, maintaining duration of status is both sound immigration policy and essential to protecting U.S. higher education, sustaining economic growth, and preserving national competitiveness in the global competition for talent.\nWhile I understand the Department’s stated goals of improving oversight and reducing visa overstays, I believe this rule will cause disproportionate harm to U.S. higher education, international competitiveness, and lawful students who already follow strict compliance measures. The proposed changes to F-1 student regulations, which would replace duration of status with fixed admission periods, would have far-reaching negative consequences for U.S. higher education and the economy. Many PhD level students require more than six years to complete their degrees, and fixed admission periods would add administrative burdens and uncertainty to an already challenging process. This data demonstrates that many undergraduate students, domestic and international, require more than four years to complete their degrees, and rigid admission periods would disproportionately penalize them. Competing countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia are actively streamlining pathways for international students, while this rule would push prospective applicants away from U.S. institutions, harming both universities and the broader U.S. economy. At public institutions, the six-year graduation rate is approximately 63% (National Center for Education Statistics), and according to the National Student Clearinghouse, the six-year completion rate for the Fall 2017 cohort was 62.2%. According to the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates, the average time to complete a PhD in the United States is approximately 7.2 years. At a time when peer countries are actively streamlining student visa processes to attract top talent, the United States risks making itself less competitive and less attractive to the very students who drive innovation and research. Creates Administrative Burdens and Risks of Unlawful Presence\nRequiring students to file extension requests with USCIS during their programs introduces unnecessary bureaucracy and processing backlogs. Because academic timelines vary due to program structure, research requirements, or personal circumstances, fixed admission periods would force students into a cycle of costly extension requests with USCIS. Duration of status has long been the cornerstone of student immigration policy, providing students with the flexibility needed to complete academic programs, conduct research, and engage in practical training without repeated federal intervention. Faced with this risk, many students may decide not to pursue education in the United States at all, preferring countries where they can complete their academic programs with certainty. Only 44% of undergraduate students graduate within 4 years of enrollment (National Center for Education Statistics). The Survey of Earned Doctorates from the National Science Foundation in 2024 estimates the average doctoral program takes 5.7 years, meaning that all doctoral international students would have to file an I-539 extension of stay form at least once. A 2024 report from the National Science Board estimates that foreign-born individuals make up 43% of doctorate-level scientists and engineers in the US. Currently, the USCIS processing times tool estimates that an I-539 extension review for F, J, and M visas takes 3.5 months, unless applicants pay a premium price of  $1,965. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, “In 2020, the overall six-year graduation rate for first-time, full-time undergraduate students who began seeking a bachelor’s degree at four-year degree-granting institutions in fall 2014 was 64 percent.” More recent data from the National Student Clearinghouse shows the pattern has not improved: by 2023, the overall six-year completion rate was 62.2 percent for the fall 2017 cohort. Almost every single doctoral student needing to file this form would significantly lengthen the wait time\nc. All of those students would have to submit extension requests for each year after the 4 year maximum, which would impose unnecessary costs and strain on USCIS and the broader immigration system. Recent data from the Association of American Universities shows that 73% of STEM international graduates continue to live and work in the US several years after graduation, providing vital scientific, technological, and economic benefits to the US. I oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (ICEB-2025-0001). I urge DHS not to implement the proposed changes to 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(i) and to maintain the current Duration of Status framework. Under risks within the F classification, DHS alleges that as of 2025, 2,100 international students have been on F-1 status for 15 years or more, have entered consecutive educational programs or transferred schools to maintain this status, and could therefore be abusing the system to stay in the US indefinitely. Countries like Canada do not impose arbitrary time limits to complete an education or force students to stay locked into a single program for at least a year. g. F-1 visas are not just limited to higher education: in 2024, there were over 54,000 international students in K-12 schools. Prohibiting graduate F-1 students from changing educational objectives or transferring from within the United States severely limits graduate-level study\n3. In 2024-25, international students contributed an estimated $46 billion to the US economy and supported 400,000 jobs, but this year, NAFSA is estimating that newly implemented visa bans and regulations affecting international students will cost the economy $7 billion and 60,000 jobs. The proposed policy changes will lead to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of extension requests that the current staff level at DHS cannot handle. Regarding the proposal to limit \"school transfer and change in educational objectives\"\na. As a current PhD student in the United States with a program length of five years, I am deeply concerned that imposing fixed admission periods would disrupt research environments, create unnecessary bureaucracy, worsen USCIS backlogs, and ultimately harm the U.S. national interest. A fixed admission period would force nearly every PhD student to file one or more EOS applications mid-program, creating unnecessary uncertainty and administrative hurdles during the most critical phases of research and training. Imposing a fixed four-year limit creates unnecessary uncertainty and administrative burden for both students and institutions, forcing students to file extensions mid-program and risking interruptions to their education. I am writing to respectfully oppose certain provisions of the proposed rule (2025-16554), which would eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F and J visa holders and replace it with a fixed admission period. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule that would replace the long-standing “Duration of Status” (D/S) policy with fixed periods of stay for F-1 student visa holders. Conclusion\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate “Duration of Status” and replace it with fixed periods of stay. The proposed changes create uncertainty around OPT eligibility and undermine the U.S.’s ability to attract and retain global talent, especially in STEM fields where international students play a key role in research and innovation. Conclusion\nThis proposed rule would disrupt academic research, overburden USCIS, harm local economies, and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. higher education. Negative Consequences for Research and Innovation\n\nMany J-1 exchange visitors and F-1 graduate students contribute to federally funded research projects vital to U.S. technological and scientific leadership. DHS itself acknowledges that USCIS already faces backlogs; adding hundreds of thousands of new EOS filings each year will compound inefficiency, delaying outcomes not only for students but for U.S. citizens awaiting immigration benefits. Administrative Inefficiency and Burden on USCIS\n\nMandating hundreds of thousands of F and J visa holders to file EOS applications every 2–4 years would drastically increase USCIS’s caseload, causing delays not only for students but also for other applicants. Inefficiency and Strain on USCIS\nThe proposed extension-of-stay (EOS) process would shift routine oversight from Designated School Officials (DSOs) and Responsible Officers (ROs) to USCIS officers, requiring new filings, biometrics, and adjudications (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 79–80, §214.1(c)). Practical Alternative\nInstead of abandoning D/S, DHS should:\n\nRetain the current D/S framework while enhancing SEVIS monitoring. This diverts resources away from education and research and creates additional stress for international students who are already navigating complex immigration rules. Proposed Alternative Solutions\n\nInstead of eliminating D/S, DHS should focus on strengthening SEVIS monitoring, improving interagency data-sharing, and enforcing existing rules more effectively. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to revoke the proposed rule to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with fixed admission periods requiring frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) applications. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to revoke the proposed rule to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with fixed admission periods requiring frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) applications.

USCIS currently faces long processing times; adding unnecessary applications will increase costs, delays, and errors for both the government and applicants. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on my analysis of global talent competition dynamics and national strategic interests. Although the rule allows for a 240-day period of continued status while an extension is pending, it is unclear whether this timeframe will remain sufficient as processing delays grow. It would harm the U.S. economy, overburden USCIS and DSOs, disrupt legitimate academic pathways, and make the U.S. a less attractive destination for global talent. More critically, employers in high-value sectors demonstrate clear preferences for hiring international students with 2-3 years of U.S. academic experience, as this period allows for cultural adaptation and professional network development that significantly enhances workplace integration and long-term retention rates. Severe Economic Consequences\nThere are currently over one million international students in the United States, who contribute substantially to the economy through tuition payments, living expenses, and tax revenue, while also supporting local jobs. The U.S. faces a rapidly aging workforce, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting 11.9 million job openings in STEM fields through 2031, while domestic STEM graduation rates remain insufficient to meet demand. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based alternatives that enhance security without undermining America's ability to attract and retain the world's most talented individuals. The current proposal represents a strategic miscalculation that weakens America's most sustainable competitive advantage—its ability to attract and retain global talent. Employers increasingly value interdisciplinary expertise—business students often seek computer science training, mathematics students pursue applied business programs, and STEM PhD graduates sometimes pursue a second degree in business, law, or policy to broaden their impact. When Canada introduced its Post-Graduation Work Permit program with predictable timelines, it captured 15% market share growth in international graduate students within three years, directly correlating with a $2.3 billion increase in their innovation economy. My analysis of current adjudication timelines suggests that adding 400,000+ annual extension filings to existing backlogs would generate average processing delays of 8-12 months, effectively forcing compliant students into unauthorized status through administrative failure rather than individual non-compliance. The existing SEVIS system already provides real-time monitoring capabilities that fixed admission periods cannot improve—it tracks enrollment status, program changes, and compliance violations more effectively than periodic application reviews. Our intelligence agencies have consistently identified talent retention as a national security priority—losing cutting-edge researchers in quantum computing, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence to competitor nations poses far greater long-term security risks than the administrative oversight challenges this rule purports to address. The proposed fixed admission periods create what economists term \"temporal mismatching\" between educational investment cycles and labor market absorption capacity. By introducing bureaucratic uncertainty precisely when these individuals are most likely to establish roots and contribute long-term, this rule undermines decades of strategic human capital investment. Instead of imposing rigid time limits and bureaucratic hurdles, DHS should work with educational institutions to strengthen existing monitoring mechanisms without undermining the ability of international students to complete their programs of study. Damage to U.S. research, innovation, and global competitiveness**\nInternational students—particularly in STEM fields—are critical to the success of America’s universities and research institutions. Imposing rigid time limits and additional barriers will deter this talent pool, disrupt research projects, and slow down the transfer of cutting-edge discoveries into the U.S. economy. I oppose this proposed rule that would replace the current “duration of status” system with a fixed admission period and extension requirements for international students, exchange visitors, and members of the foreign media. The existing SEVIS system already tracks students and exchange visitors. Impact on Communities and Citizens\n\nThis is not just an “international student issue.” International students and visitors are woven into the fabric of our communities. I respectfully suggest Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  withdraw this proposed rule and retain the current “Duration of Status (D/S)” framework. The proposed rule would force me—and thousands like me—to interrupt my academic progress to apply for an EOS, incurring additional costs, biometric appointments, and uncertainty during a critical phase of my education. By creating uncertainty and discouraging enrollment, the proposed rule risks driving students toward other countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, who actively welcome them. From the mid-20th century onward—including the influx of scientists and scholars fleeing Europe during World War II—immigrant talent has powered America’s rise in science, technology, and national security. We should remember that during World War II, it was immigrant scientists like Albert Einstein and others who helped secure America’s leadership in science, technology, and national security. America’s ability to attract and retain international students and scholars is not just an immigration matter—it is a cornerstone of U.S. innovation, economic vitality, and national security. Restricting international students today would repeat the mistakes of other nations that shut their doors to talent, and it would weaken the very foundation of U.S. strength: openness, opportunity, and global leadership in higher education. Harm to U.S. higher education and local economies**\nInternational students are not only vital to campus diversity and excellence but also contribute tens of billions of dollars annually in tuition and living expenses. While I understand the goal of improving oversight, the rule as written would harm U.S. competitiveness, weaken higher education, and undermine national interests. Strategic Competition & National Innovation\nThe United States’ global leadership in STEM depends heavily on international students: over 50 % of international students pursue STEM fields, with particularly strong representation in computer science and engineering graduate programs. I write as an international student enrolled in a graduate STEM program in the United States to oppose the proposed rule, DHS-2025-0250-0001, which would eliminate the “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. Because international students are subject to immigration rules based on nationality, program, and institutional status, such rigid limits could have discriminatory effects—and risk legal challenges on grounds of due process, equal protection, and international human rights norms. This introduces a significant element of uncertainty that could derail long-term research projects and discourage the world's most talented students from pursuing their advanced degrees in the U.S.\n\n\nSecond, the proposed rule will increase administrative burden and costs for education systems. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would end the \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) framework for F-1 and J-1 students and replace it with fixed admission terms capped at four years. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the D/S framework to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in higher education and innovation. Risk of Talent Drain & Loss of Appeal\nIncreased bureaucratic hurdles—such as fixed admission periods, mandatory extensions, restrictions on program changes, shortened grace periods—will discourage international students from coming to or staying in the U.S. Oversight Goals\nWhile DHS asserts that fixed admissions periods would improve oversight and prevent “visa abuse,” the existing D/S framework already requires rigorous monitoring via SEVP/SEVIS, institutional reporting, and university compliance. The existing SEVIS system already provides adequate oversight, and the proposed changes would harm the U.S.'s reputation as a welcoming and flexible destination for international students and visitors. I respectfully urge the Department to reconsider this rule, which I believe would undermine U.S. strategic advantage, inflict substantial economic harm, induce a talent drain, and pose serious legal and human rights concerns. As a researcher at a major university in Texas, I can attest to the detrimental effects this change would have on U.S. higher education, scientific research, and our local economy. Last but not least, this policy threatens to undermine U.S. scientific leadership and the economic contributions of international students. The proposed change essentially duplicates oversight efforts, adding bureaucracy without a significant new security benefit.\nThe Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was created to track foreign students after 9/11 and already provides continuous monitoring of a student's enrollment and academic progress. For universities, the change would shift the responsibility for managing student status from designated school officials (DSOs) to a centralized federal agency, adding layers of bureaucracy. Replacing duration of status with fixed end dates, cutting the F-1 grace period to 30 days, and routing routine extensions through USCIS would make it harder to finish my degree, start OPT, and transition to long-term work that benefits the United States. Shortening the grace period to 30 days compresses time to depart, extend, change status, or onboard to post-completion training, turning normal academic timing into a legal hazard. Duration of status has long been the cornerstone of student immigration policy, providing students with the flexibility needed to complete academic programs, conduct research, and engage in practical training without repeated federal intervention. For universities, this change would impose significant administrative burdens on Designated School Officials, increase compliance costs, and likely lead to a decline in enrollment, as students may opt for study destinations with more predictable immigration pathways, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, or Australia. Harm to U.S. government efficiency:\nMoving predictable, low-risk extensions from campus oversight to USCIS will swell workloads, increase processing delays, and generate technical overstays from timing issues. Less-burdensome alternatives that meet DHS goals:\n\nRetain duration of status and add a standardized SEVIS check-in (for example, at candidacy or credit milestones) to create the “predetermined” oversight points DHS seeks without flooding USCIS with routine extensions. Many PhD level students require more than six years to complete their degrees, and fixed admission periods would add administrative burdens and uncertainty to an already challenging process. The proposed changes to F-1 student regulations, which would replace duration of status with fixed admission periods, would have far-reaching negative consequences for U.S. higher education and the economy. This data demonstrates that many undergraduate students, domestic and international, require more than four years to complete their degrees, and rigid admission periods would disproportionately penalize them. For these reasons, maintaining duration of status is both sound immigration policy and essential to protecting U.S. higher education, sustaining economic growth, and preserving national competitiveness in the global competition for talent. Faced with this risk, many students may decide not to pursue education in the United States at all, preferring countries where they can complete their academic programs with certainty. At a time when peer countries are actively streamlining student visa processes to attract top talent, the United States risks making itself less competitive and less attractive to the very students who drive innovation and research. The proposal turns ordinary delays (lab backorders, failed experiments, committee changes) into status crises, creating avoidable withdrawals, talent loss from labs, and broken collaborations that slow U.S. research output. Conclusion:\nThis framework would reduce government efficiency, shrink economic gains, undercut research, and diminish U.S. attractiveness to top scholars. According to NAFSA, international students contributed nearly $40 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 368,000 jobs in the 2022–2023 academic year. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed a new rule titled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” This rule aims to replace the long-standing “duration of status” (D/S) framework with a fixed four-year stay limit for F, J, and I visa holders, along with a new extension application process. ICEB-2025-0001)\n\nExecutive Summary\nAs an employee at Meta, I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. As a Meta employee, I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and preserve the duration of status framework, while enhancing oversight through existing mechanisms. The proposed four-year admission cap and reduced 30-day grace period (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 87–89, §III.B)would disrupt educational timelines and transition into Optional Practical Training (OPT), jeopardizing their ability to enter the workforce. In conclusion, the proposed four-year cap is a shortsighted policy that would undermine American graduate education, harm our economy, and cede our competitive advantage to other nations. This policy, while perhaps well-intentioned, is fundamentally misaligned with the realities of graduate education in the United States and would trigger severe negative consequences for academia, the U.S. economy, and our nation's status as a global leader in innovation. By creating an unstable and unwelcoming visa environment, we risk pushing this top-tier global talent to competitor nations like Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany, which are actively implementing more favorable immigration policies for scholars and researchers. Competitive Global Landscape\nCountries like Canada and the United Kingdom are expanding their post-study work opportunities to attract STEM graduates. For employers like Meta, the hidden costs include interrupted projects, increased recruitment expenses, and risks of losing key talent to competitor nations. The rule also threatens to remove the flexibility for PhD students to “master out”—that is, to exit their doctoral programs early while earning a master’s degree and pursuing Optional Practical Training (OPT). The new rule would require many students—especially PhD candidates, whose programs often exceed five years in length—to file costly and time-consuming extension requests to maintain legal status. International students contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy, according to NAFSA, and they make up a significant portion of graduate STEM programs. Conclusion\nThis rule would undermine the innovation pipeline, burden universities and employers, and make the U.S. less attractive for top global talent — without offering proportional security benefits. This regulation would not only jeopardize the academic careers of countless students but also disrupt vital, long-term research projects at American universities that contribute to science, technology, and medicine. The rule would undermine the educational-to-workforce pipeline that fuels innovation in the U.S. technology sector. I strongly oppose the proposed rule ICEB-2025-0001 by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which seeks to (1) eliminate the “Duration of Status” (D/S) provision for F-1 students, and (2) prohibit international students from pursuing a second master’s degree at the same or lower level. Lack of Data Support & Unnecessary Burdens\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserts that eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) would mitigate national security risks by requiring students to apply for extensions of stay (EOS) and undergo periodic vetting (DHS, 2025). I respectfully submit this comment to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F-1, J-1, and I nonimmigrants, replacing it with a fixed period of admission. Unnecessary Administrative Burden: Requiring students and exchange visitors to file extension of stay (EOS) applications for routine academic progress diverts time and resources away from education. It threatens the United States’ role as a global leader in higher education and innovation while placing undue burdens on students, universities, and government agencies alike. Otherwise, the U.S. risks discouraging talent, undermining its own competitiveness, and discarding the very strengths that have made its higher education system the envy of the world. As the saying goes: “Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.” Eliminating D/S and restricting second master’s degrees would not solve isolated cases of abuse, but instead remove opportunities that have fueled innovation, supported the economy, and strengthened U.S. global leadership. •\tAllow international students to pursue up to five master’s degrees at U.S.(including second master’s programs), provided they maintain good standing in SEVIS and demonstrate academic/professional progression. Restricting D/S and prohibiting second master’s degrees would likely reduce the number of international students, thereby decreasing these economic benefits. Competing countries such as Canada and the EU actively attract these students, meaning the U.S. risks losing both immediate financial contributions and long-term global competitiveness. The proposal, while intended to address overstays, is based largely on speculation rather than data, and it would impose significant economic, educational, and social costs on the United States. Imposing uncertainty and costs on international students will drive them to competitor countries (Canada, UK, Australia) with more stable policies. Stripping this protection mid-course undermines reliance interests recognized in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California (2020). Cutting short their lawful presence or discouraging their enrollment undermines U.S. leadership in science and technology. This is counterproductive at a time when the U.S. seeks to maintain leadership in technology, healthcare, and research. Academic Flexibility and Lifelong Learning\nThe rule proposes to limit changes in educational objectives and restrict students from pursuing additional programs at the same or lower level of study (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 102, §214.2(f)). The proposed restrictions—such as reducing the grace period after study from 60 to 30 days and prohibiting graduate students from changing programs mid-course (Proposed Rule PDF, pp. The proposed rule would impose unnecessary burdens, discourage talented students, and undermine the significant contributions international students make to U.S. education and the economy. As an international student who has just begun my Ph.D. program in Computer Science at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, my academic plan is to dedicate the next five to six years to advanced research in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nWorld-class research institutions like Rutgers University, particularly its distinguished Department of Computer Science, rely heavily on a global pool of graduate students to drive innovation. Global Competitiveness\nThe U.S. has long been the top destination for international education, attracting individuals who contribute to research, innovation, and cultural exchange. As someone who has studied in the United States for over 10 years—from high school through a master’s degree—I have directly experienced how flexible academic pathways are essential for both student success and U.S. competitiveness. Prospective Ph.D. students, especially in a competitive field like Computer Science, will logically choose to study in countries like Canada or the U.K., which offer more stable immigration policies. Competing countries like Canada and the U.K. are expanding pathways for international students. Economic and Institutional Impact\nInternational students pay full tuition rates, often significantly higher than domestic students, which directly supports U.S. universities and local economies. For a Ph.D. student, having to reapply for an extension or a new visa mid-program is not just an administrative hurdle; it is a critical disruption. While studying here, I contribute directly to the New Jersey economy through my tuition, rent in the New Brunswick area, and daily spending that supports local businesses. Instead of protecting program integrity, the rule risks reducing enrollment and the tuition revenue that sustains many U.S. institutions. These costs—both financial and administrative—are unjustified, especially when SEVIS already provides oversight and compliance mechanisms. Practical Alternatives\nInstead of dismantling D/S, DHS should:\n* Retain duration of status while strengthening SEVIS reporting requirements. Dear DHS,\nAs a university faculty member in the United States, I am writing to comment on the proposed rule published on August 28, 2025, which seeks to eliminate \"duration of status\" for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with a fixed-term admission period. Comment Regarding Proposed Rule: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media (RIN 1653-ZA30)\n\nTo the Department of Homeland Security,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule, \"Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.\" Administrative and Financial Burden\nReplacing the \"duration of status\" (D/S) system with a fixed four-year admission period and requiring a separate extension application would create a massive bureaucratic bottleneck. The uncertainty and burdensome process of frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) applications would create significant disruptions to long-term research projects and could lead to the departure of highly skilled researchers before their work is completed. For example, my own research in [mention your specific area of research] depends on the work of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who often require more than a fixed four-year period to complete their complex projects and dissertations. Reasoning & Supporting Evidence\nBased on the established norms of academic research and graduate education, the proposed requirement for fixed-term admissions is fundamentally misaligned with the nature of these programs. This will inevitably result in a significant talent drain as promising students and scholars choose to pursue their work in countries with more stable and welcoming immigration policies, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. This rule would create a climate of instability, prompting prospective students to choose more welcoming and less restrictive destinations like Canada, the United Kingdom, or Australia. While I understand the stated goal of improving oversight and deterring visa fraud, the proposed changes would have significant and detrimental impacts on international students, U.S. academic institutions, and the overall competitiveness of the United States in the global landscape. * Increased Workload for USCIS: This new process would force hundreds of thousands of F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrants to file an Extension of Stay application (Form I-539) with U.S. This inefficiency will not only harm the students and scholars awaiting adjudication but will also slow down the processing of other critical immigration petitions, ultimately hindering our ability to attract the world's best and brightest. This long-standing policy has been effective in allowing students and scholars to remain in the U.S. for the time required to complete their academic and research objectives, contributing immense value to our country in the process. Impact of the Proposed Rule\nThis rule will significantly and negatively impact the ability of U.S. universities to recruit and retain top global talent, thereby undermining our nation's research and innovation competitiveness. Background\nAs a faculty member in the STEM field, my research and teaching heavily rely on the contributions of international students and scholars, many of whom are in F-1 or J-1 status. * Discouraging Top Talent: International students contribute significantly to the U.S. economy, both directly through tuition and fees and indirectly through their research and innovation. Surging administrative burden that undermines efficiency\nThe policy would require hundreds of thousands of students each year to file I-539 extension applications, sharply increasing USCIS workload, diverting capacity from other case types, worsening backlogs, and adding pressure on campus Designated School Officials (DSOs). Excessive Administrative Burden\nThe rule would compel hundreds of thousands of students annually to file Form I-539 for extensions of stay, substantially increasing USCIS’s workload and exacerbating already severe processing delays across benefit categories. Administrative Burdens on Universities\nThe rule would require students to seek repeated extensions and submit biometrics to maintain lawful status (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 87–89, §III.B). Significant economic harm, with costs outweighing benefits\nThe United States currently hosts approximately one million international students who support substantial employment, contribute meaningfully to economic growth and tax revenues, and help offset tuition costs for domestic students. I respectfully urge the agency to reconsider the proposal and work with universities and stakeholders to craft targeted, evidence-based measures that safeguard program integrity while preserving the United States’ long-standing strengths in education, research, and innovation. They support job creation, drive economic growth, contribute to federal and state tax revenues, and provide substantial tuition revenue that reduces the financial burden on domestic students. It is common and academically sound for students to pursue interdisciplinary or sequential degrees—for example, a business graduate undertaking a computer science program, a mathematics graduate pursuing an applied business degree, or a STEM PhD graduate later entering professional studies such as law (LLM/JD) or business (MBA). Unreasonable Restrictions on Subsequent Degrees and Program Changes\nThe proposed rule fails to account for legitimate academic and professional pathways that involve pursuing more than one degree or changing fields of study. It is reasonable for a business graduate to pursue a computer science degree, for a mathematics graduate to pivot into an applied business program, or for a STEM PhD to later undertake an MBA or a law degree (LLM/JD). Incompatibility with PhD Programs\nA maximum four-year admission period is unrealistic for the vast majority of doctoral programs in the United States. STEM PhD programs commonly take five to six years to complete, and humanities and social sciences often require even more time. Unworkable for PhD programs\nLimiting each I-94 admission to a maximum of four years is misaligned with the realities of doctoral education. This rule would severely undermine the nation’s ability to attract and retain top global talent, with detrimental long-term consequences for academic excellence and national competitiveness. The proposed restrictions fail to account for these legitimate academic and professional pathways. Graduates in fields such as engineering, computer science, and health sciences fill workforce gaps that benefit both industry and national competitiveness. Subject: Comment on Proposed Regulation Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media\n\nIntroduction: I am writing as a graduate student currently on Optional Practical Training. Analysis: The proposed regulation creates a series of traps and bureaucratic roadblocks that would discourage global talent from considering the U.S as a place to further their education, thereby causing a severe impact to U.S research and innovation, it's economic competitiveness and technological leadership. The proposed 4-year fixed duration period would require a student looking to pursue employment under STEM OPT regulation to file for an extension midway through their STEM extension period. Reducing the window for departure preparation from 60 days to 30 days would cause significant hurdles for students at the end of their programs, diluting their valuable academic and research contributions. Make it clear that if a student files a timely extension—even within that grace period—their CPT, OPT, or on-campus work continues for up to 240 days. The rule also shortens the grace period from 60 days to 30 days. Please adopt targeted fixes: keep the grace period realistic, clarify employment continuation, allow legitimate complementary academic transfers, streamline the extension process, and honor commitments to current students. Unnecessary bureaucracy - This proposal would generate hundreds of thousands of additional applications for USCIS to process, from students who are in perfect academic standing, and would be on a good pathway to contributing to the research and economic goals of the U.S prior to these regulations. My experience navigating the challenges of international education provides me with direct insight into the practical implications of the proposal seeking to establish a fixed time period of admission. On the other hand, the F visa classification is for students pursuing full-time programs, undergraduate and graduate, in the U.S. As such, wrapping up prior commitments, completing financial, housing, and regulatory requirements is likely to take longer for students on an F visa. That means thousands of students will need to file extra paperwork (I-539 extensions), creating longer processing queues and more uncertainty.\nReduction in departure preparation window for F visa classification - The proposed regulation alludes to the fact that the F visa classification is distinct from M or J visa classification. Most troubling, the rule would ban graduate students from transferring in-country or switching programs, and stop students from pursuing another program at the same or lower level. Permit graduate students to pursue academically distinct programs at the same level when the programs are complementary and career-relevant, with DSO certification. On graduate transfers and complementary degrees\nFrom an employer’s standpoint, preventing graduate students from making legitimate academic pivots is short-sighted. DHS estimates annualized costs of $390–392 million over 10 years for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and U.S. institutions combined (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 97, Summary of Costs and Benefits). The proposed shift from Duration of Status (D/S) to fixed terms with frequent Extensions of Stay (EOS) requirements would, albeit unintentionally, undermine this foundation. ICEB-2025-0001 – Opposing Proposed Rule to Replace “Duration of Status” with Fixed Admission Periods for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\n\nExecutive Summary\nI respectfully oppose the proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) and replace it with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I visa holders. A fixed 4-year maximum would force most students into repeated EOS filings in the middle of their normal academic progress, disrupting research continuity and diminishing U.S. institutions’ ability to attract and retain global talent in critical research fields. By adding uncertainty and barriers, the U.S. risks losing top talent to competitors and eroding its long-term leadership in science and technology. V. Weakened U.S. Appeal to Global Talent\n\nIn the 2023/24 academic year, international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,000 jobs. Escalating Administrative and Social Burdens\n\nAccording to DHS’s own estimates, this policy would impose $390–392 million in annual social costs and generate over 400,000 additional EOS applications each year. Under the proposed rule, students would face uncertainty over whether their extensions of stay (EOS) will be approved in time to complete degree programs, adding stress and distraction. Administrative Burden and Costs\nThe proposal requires students to submit EOS applications directly to DHS, including biometric collection, which adds significant time and financial burdens. As an international student pursuing graduate education in the United States, I believe the change would create unnecessary barriers to academic success, disrupt career development opportunities, and impose costs without clear benefits. DHS itself acknowledges that delays or program changes—such as academic probation, transferring, or progressing to a higher degree—may not be considered sufficient reasons for an extension (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 112, §214.2(f)). •\tClarifying transparent and consistent criteria for extensions that account for normal academic progress, program changes, and higher degree pursuits. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead improve the existing D/S framework with targeted oversight. Misalignment with Doctoral and Long-Duration Programs\n\nData from the National Science Foundation show that the median time to a Ph.D. is 6.8 years, with humanities often taking even longer. Practical Alternatives\nRather than eliminating D/S, DHS could strengthen oversight within the existing framework by:\n\t•\tRetaining D/S but requiring periodic reporting through SEVIS, which already provides real-time monitoring. ICEB-2025-0001\n\nI respectfully oppose DHS’s proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” The proposal is legally flawed, administratively burdensome, and contrary to congressional intent in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and standards of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). DHS should withdraw it and pursue evidence-based reforms: enhanced SEVIS audits, interagency data integration, targeted enforcement against high-risk cases, and preservation of D/S, which has proven effective for decades. The Proposal's Fixed-Term Admission is Unworkable and Unnecessarily Harmful\n\nConflicts with Graduate Education: The rule ignores that the average U.S. Ph.D. takes 5.7 years to complete (NSF, 2024). Economic and operational impact:\nInternational students and exchange visitors contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support more than 300,000 jobs (Dept. By imposing millions of predictable extension-of-stay (EOS) filings annually, the rule will overburden USCIS and divert resources from security-focused adjudications, a failure to consider alternatives noted in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. The combined costs, risks, and bureaucratic hurdles will deter global talent from all levels of U.S. education, including the over 54,000 international students in K-12 schools. I urge the department to instead focus on targeted enforcement actions and maintain the stable, predictable, and proven Duration of Status framework that has served the interests of the United States for decades. Conclusion:\nThis proposal exceeds statutory authority, ignores reliance interests, and imposes sweeping burdens while offering negligible security gains. FCC v. Fox Television Stations requires a reasoned explanation when departing from established policy; this rule disregards reliance interests of schools, employers, and students who have structured programs around D/S. Nationality-based provisions:\nI-visa restrictions uniquely targeting PRC passport holders—including mandatory work cessation beyond 90 days if EOS remains pending—raise serious equal protection and diplomatic concerns. Administrative burden:\nMandatory EOS filings for every F/J visa holder, shortened grace periods, and work restrictions will produce status gaps, job loss, and logistical challenges. Without narrowly tailored, evidence-based justification, these provisions could face litigation similar to nationality-based restrictions reviewed in Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S.Ct.2392 (2018). Students and scholars face life-changing consequences when extensions are denied; depriving applicants of review opportunities invites inconsistent outcomes, contrary to APA principles and due process expectations. Exacerbates USCIS Backlogs: This would overwhelm USCIS, which already has a record 11.3 million pending cases (Q2 FY 2025). DHS has not accounted for these consequences or their cumulative effect on USCIS backlogs and applicant compliance. I am writing in opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” While the Department of Homeland Security has justified this rule as a means to improve oversight, the economic consequences would be profoundly negative for the United States. Dear Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n\nThis rule would eliminate the current “Duration of Status (D/S)” framework for F and J nonimmigrants, replacing it with fixed admission periods and requiring extensions of stay through USCIS. The proposal would replace “duration of status” admissions for F-1/J-1 students with fixed, date-certain admissions (generally capped at four years) and force students to apply to USCIS—paying fees, providing biometrics, and waiting on adjudications—just to remain in lawful status while completing normal academic progress. New “change of educational objectives” limits—including barring below-graduate students from changing programs in the first academic year—would penalize normal academic exploration and legitimate transfers, making the U.S. less attractive compared to competitor countries. These added burdens create not only financial strain but also psychological uncertainty, making the U.S. a less attractive destination compared to countries such as Canada, the U.K., and Australia, which maintain more flexible study visa systems. It would also cap English-language study at 24 months and restrict program changes and transfers (including limitations on changing educational objectives in the first academic year). The proposed rule adds complexity, cost, and risk to routine academic progress, deters talented students from choosing the United States, and threatens billions in economic activity and hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs that depend on international education. I strongly urge DHS to preserve the current D/S framework and avoid implementing measures that will weaken America’s higher education system, innovation capacity, and global standing. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, international students contributed over $40 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2022–2023 academic year alone. Interruptions caused by pending extension adjudications may derail critical projects, discourage talented researchers from choosing the U.S., and ultimately slow America’s progress in science, technology, and innovation—contradicting the nation’s stated goal of strengthening global competitiveness. I respectfully urge DHS/ICE to withdraw the proposal and pursue targeted, data-driven oversight that combats abuse without undermining the lawful students, universities, employers, and communities that strengthen our economy and global leadership. To remain competitive in a global economy, the United States must continue to attract and retain international talent, not discourage it with arbitrary restrictions and costly bureaucratic hurdles. NAFSA’s recent outlook warns of a potential $7 billion loss and ~60,000 jobs at risk from declines in international student enrollment driven by policy uncertainty and processing constraints. Conclusion\nThis rule offers little additional security benefit while imposing heavy administrative and economic costs on students and institutions, jeopardizing U.S. leadership in education and research. While intended to improve oversight, the rule will cause significant harm to U.S. higher education, research, and the nation’s competitiveness.\nI respectfully submit this comment opposing the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” My concern is that this rule would profoundly disrupt academic research and innovation in the United States, harming not only international students but also American faculty, institutions, and the nation’s global standing in science and technology. The Rule Will Harm America's Economic and Intellectual Competitiveness:\nThe United States' greatest competitive advantage is its ability to attract and retain global talent. If the United States signals that students may be forced to interrupt or abandon their work, we will lose these talented individuals to global competitors. Curtailing their ability to complete long-term studies will weaken the talent pipeline, delay scientific advances, and risk shifting research leadership to other countries. By creating barriers that disrupt their ability to complete long-term projects, this rule risks undercutting decades of U.S. leadership in higher education and scientific discovery. Nations like Canada, Germany, and Australia are actively recruiting international students with policies designed to encourage long-term study and research. Intellectual Damage: International students fill our graduate programs, particularly in critical STEM fields. For these reasons, I urge DHS to withdraw this harmful and misguided proposed rule in its entirety. International students make up a large proportion of graduate enrollments in STEM fields—over 50% in many engineering and computer science programs. The proposed rule replaces this efficient, context-sensitive system with rigid deadlines and discretionary USCIS adjudications, which are ill-suited to evaluating academic progress. Economic Damage: International students are a massive economic engine. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, international students contributed $33.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 335,000 jobs during the 2022-2023 academic year. For these reasons, I urge DHS to withdraw the proposal. A student who has lived in the U.S. for 4-8 years needs more than 30 days to responsibly conclude their affairs—sell furniture, end a lease, ship belongings, close accounts, and travel. Imagine a student on the verge of completing groundbreaking experiments, but forced to halt work because their extension is stuck in a USCIS backlog. A more effective and balanced approach would be to maintain “Duration of Status (D/S)” while strengthening oversight through:\n\t•\tTargeted risk-based screening instead of blanket restrictions,\n\t•\tEarly academic progress verification by universities,\n\t•\tStricter accreditation for institutions hosting F-1 students and their OPT/CPT issuement\n\n\nThese measures directly address potential security concerns while preserving the academic freedom, flexibility, and economic contributions that make U.S. higher education globally competitive. Adds Bureaucracy—Harming Students and Institutions\nRequiring extensions for routine academic needs places unnecessary burdens on students, universities, and DSOs. The proposed rule would make these potential pathways nearly impossible, leaving students without academic safety nets. I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate the longstanding “duration of status” (D/S) policy for F-1 and J-1 visa holders, replacing it with a fixed admission period of up to four years. For these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS/ICE to withdraw this proposal and preserve the existing D/S framework for F, J, and I visa holders. Our department regularly collaborates with scholars from Europe and Asia through J-1 and I visa programs. This proposed rule would severely disrupt their ability to study, conduct research, and collaborate in the U.S.\n\nPh.D. programs in my field typically last 5–7 years, especially when projects involve laboratory experimentation or federally funded research. The proposed rule will harm U.S. higher education and research by introducing unnecessary barriers for students, scholars, and institutions. I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (ICEB-2025-0001). Direct Harm to PhD Students\n- PhD programs in the U.S. typically last 5–7 years, far longer than the proposed four-year cap. Under the current system, Designated School Officials (DSOs) already report on academic progress and program changes in SEVIS, giving DHS real-time visibility. Continuing education, program transfers, or OPT participation would require filing an extension application (Form I-539) with USCIS, including fees, biometrics, and potential delays. This rigidity will deter top global PhD talent from coming to the U.S., leading to a serious loss of highly trained researchers that are critical for America’s innovation ecosystem. Global Competitiveness\nInternational students enrich academic communities, drive innovation, and help fill critical STEM and research workforce gaps. As a university professor, I have mentored international students and hosted visiting scholars who play essential roles in advancing research and enriching the academic environment of our institution. As a university faculty member in computer science who advises and trains international students at the undergraduate, master’s, and Ph.D. levels, I respectfully oppose DHS’s proposal to replace Duration of Status (D/S) with fixed admission end dates—generally capped at four years—and to restrict program changes and second degrees for F-1 students. 1) Four years is misaligned with Ph.D. reality and will harm U.S. research\n\nThe proposal assumes most students can complete within four years. NSF’s Survey of Earned Doctorates shows the median time to an S&E Ph.D. from doctoral program start is ~5.6 years (and ~6.8 years from the start of graduate school), with computer and information sciences following the same pattern. These changes will damage U.S. research capacity, reduce our global competitiveness for talent, and harm local economies that depend on higher education. 2) In a global competition for students, new U.S. restrictions will weaken our position and campus finances\n\nU.S. higher education competes directly with peer systems that pair study with predictable post-study options. By contrast, this NPRM would bar F-1 undergraduates from changing majors or levels in the first academic year and prohibit F-1 graduate students from changing programs at any point, policies that run counter to the exploratory norm of U.S. education and will deter enrollment. A four-year cap would force large numbers of Ph.D. candidates into repetitive, adjudication-heavy extensions—introducing uncertainty into grant-funded projects, delaying publications, and destabilizing advisor–student research plans. So, I request the following revisions:\n\na) Retain D/S for F and J or adopt a default D/S with risk-based review, rather than a hard four-year cap that misfits Ph.D. training timelines. Increased Risk and Uncertainty for Students and Institutions\nFixed-term admission would force thousands of international students either to leave the U.S. or apply for extensions during their studies. DHS/ICE recorded 1,582,808 active F-1/M-1 records in 2024 (up 5.3% from 2023), and NAFSA estimates international students contributed $43.8B and supported ~378,000 U.S. jobs in AY 2023–24. If certain programs or schools present national-security concerns, DHS should craft program- and institution-specific safeguards, not sector-wide prohibitions that penalize bona fide students and the campuses that rely on them. I urge DHS to withdraw or substantially revise these provisions. In sum, the NPRM’s fixed time limits and categorical restrictions are misaligned with the realities of U.S. graduate education, particularly Ph.D. research, and will undercut America’s ability to attract, train, and retain global STEM talent. The D/S policy allows students to finish their programs without facing the burden of mid-course visa renewals, provided they maintain enrollment and meet SEVIS reporting requirements. Visa renewals are inherently uncertain and often influenced by factors unrelated to a student’s academic record. Ending D/S and replacing it with fixed periods of admission would not only discourage international students from choosing the United States but also impose hidden costs on American families, undermine our defense research base, and expand federal bureaucracy at the expense of taxpayers. Conclusion\nEliminating D/S shifts costs onto taxpayers, disrupts defense research, grows federal bureaucracy, and interferes with free market competition. Burden on State Universities and Local Taxpayers\nIn Texas and other states, international students play a crucial role in sustaining higher education. As a global talent strategy consultant, I have observed firsthand how immigration policy changes ripple through international talent markets, and this proposal represents a catastrophic miscalculation that will accelerate America's brain drain while strengthening competitor nations. True Economic Nationalism: Global Talent Fuels American Strength\n“Buy American, Hire American” should not mean closing the door to foreign-born innovators who choose to contribute here. The United States built its innovation leadership by attracting the world's best minds and providing them stability to pursue ambitious goals. Docket DHS-2025-0250-0001\nTo the Department of Homeland Security, Docket Clerk:\nAs a professor from Texas and a taxpayer, I write to urge DHS to preserve the Duration of Status (D/S) policy for F-1 students and J-1 exchange visas. I recommend DHS instead pursue targeted reforms: enhance SEVIS analytics to identify genuine compliance risks, streamline renewal processes through digital automation, and create safe harbor provisions for students in good standing. Risk of Talent Drain to Allied Competitors\nIf DHS imposes fixed stay periods with recurring extensions, students and researchers will redirect to more welcoming countries.\nI write as a concerned American citizen with a background in economics and national security to oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposal to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrants (DHS Docket No. This rule, though framed as a security measure, would weaken America’s global competitiveness, impose unnecessary economic costs, and inadvertently advance the strategic goals of competitor nations. Conclusion\nEliminating D/S for F and J nonimmigrants would harm America’s national security, economic competitiveness, and global leadership. The administrative burden of processing hundreds of thousands of additional extension applications will overwhelm USCIS capacity while generating minimal security benefits beyond existing SEVIS monitoring. Replacing D/S with fixed admission periods and extension requests will deter top-tier students from choosing U.S. institutions. International students contributed over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy pre-pandemic, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs. As an educator in a US national university, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule \"Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media\" (ICEB-2025-0001). I am writing in strong opposition to the proposed regulation that would replace “Duration of Status” (D/S) with a fixed time period of admission for F-1 students, J-1 exchange visitors, and I visa holders. The proposed rule would make the U.S. far less attractive compared to countries like Canada, the U.K., and Germany, which are actively expanding pathways for international students and researchers. My opposition is based on the following key points:\n\nFinancial Harm to U.S. Higher Education: U.S. universities have become increasingly reliant on tuition fees from international students to support their operations. It threatens the financial health of our higher education system, puts American jobs at risk, and is an ill-conceived solution to a problem that can be addressed more effectively through targeted enforcement of existing regulations. My opposition is based on the following key concerns:\n\nCurrently, over one million international students are enrolled in U.S. institutions, significantly contributing to the U.S. economy by supporting over 400,000 jobs and contributing billions in tuition revenue and local spending annually. As a current Ph.D. student in a STEM field, I strongly oppose the proposed regulation that seeks to limit the duration of stay for F and J nonimmigrants to a fixed period, typically four years. Requiring hundreds of thousands of students to file Form I-539 extensions every 4 years—or more frequently in some cases—will drastically increase the workload of USCIS, leading to severe backlogs and longer processing times for all immigration categories. A four-year I-94 limit is completely disconnected from academic realities, forcing almost all Ph.D. students to file at least one, often multiple, status extension applications during their studies. As an international researcher currently in the United States on F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT), I believe this rule would severely harm both individuals like myself and the broader U.S. research and innovation ecosystem. Impact on National Interest: My own research directly aligns with U.S. federal funding priorities in cardiovascular disease (the leading cause of death in the United States) and trauma care (a major concern for the Department of Defense and civilian health systems). These projects directly support U.S. priorities in public health, biomedical innovation, and military and civilian trauma care. Administrative Burden and Uncertainty: The requirement to file extensions, pay fees, undergo biometrics, and potentially attend interviews for simple program changes introduces unnecessary barriers. A policy that undermines STEM doctoral education is fundamentally at odds with America’s long-standing commitment to attracting top global talent. Reducing flexibility in program changes and shortening grace periods will deter future talent from choosing the U.S., ultimately weakening American leadership in science and technology. Restriction on Pursuing Another Degree at the Same Educational Level\n\nThe proposal to prohibit F-1 students from pursuing a second program at the same educational level (e.g., a second master’s degree) creates significant challenges for international students and risks undermining the competitiveness of U.S. higher education. Restricting students from pursuing another degree at the same level removes valuable flexibility, undermines innovation, and risks losing talent to other countries. It would weaken the U.S.’s ability to attract and retain global talent, inflict financial harm on universities, and place unfair burdens on students who are here legally and in good faith. At a time when international enrollment is already projected to decline by 30–40% due to restrictive policies and the pandemic, imposing further barriers will only drive students toward competitor nations such as Canada, the U.K., and Australia—countries eager to welcome them. According to the Institute of International Education (IIE), nearly 40% of international students come from countries where travel costs exceed $1,000 per trip, making repeated renewals unaffordable. Competitiveness: The U.S. hosts about 1 million international students annually (2023/24 figures), who collectively contribute over $40 billion per year to the U.S. economy and support more than 368,000 U.S. jobs (NAFSA data). Imposing fixed admission periods without addressing the burdens of visa renewals would add significant cost and complexity, discouraging students and straining U.S. consular resources. Fixed admission periods create exactly the kind of bureaucratic uncertainty that drives talented individuals toward competitor destinations. Burden of Fixed Admission Periods and Visa Renewal Requirements\n\nInternational students already face a time-consuming and costly visa renewal process. Conclusion\n\nWhile I recognize DHS’s intent to standardize admission periods, these proposed changes could unintentionally harm U.S. higher education, research, and economic interests. Recent data from the Institute of International Education shows that alternative destinations are already gaining market share among STEM graduate students—a trend this rule would accelerate. I strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this proposal and instead collaborate with educators and stakeholders to design policies that protect national security while preserving the flexibility and openness that have long made U.S. higher education the global gold standard. I respectfully urge DHS to reconsider these provisions and to pursue alternatives that balance immigration oversight with policies that continue to attract and retain the world’s best and brightest students to the United States. The current duration of status framework, combined with continuous SEVIS monitoring, already provides real-time compliance tracking without creating the desperation that drives poor decision-making. The United States cannot afford to cede talent acquisition leadership to competitors through self-imposed bureaucratic barriers. The proposed fixed admission periods and additional EOS burdens are misaligned with the realities of doctoral training, add significant cost and risk for compliant students and institutions, and will diminish the United States’ standing as the premier destination for advanced research. If improvement is needed, we support:\n\n1) Improved SEVIS-to-employer transparency\n\n2) Faster USCIS processing for OPT/STEM OPT\n\n3) Risk-based audits for genuine compliance concerns\n\nBut removing a working pipeline and replacing it with a bureaucratic trap will only hurt the very systems that make U.S. education and innovation thrive. Fixed, short admission periods will undermine that progress by injecting avoidable uncertainty into the very training pipeline that powers U.S. innovation. This rule would:\n\n1) Disrupt lawful internship-to-hire pipelines\n\n2) Create hiring risk and administrative burden\n\n3) Undermine academic and technical progression\n\n4) Push global talent—and the innovation they drive—toward other countries\n\n1. Without this policy, jobs don’t go to Americans—they go unfilled or go abroad\nThe harsh reality is that if we lose access to international graduates, many of those roles will not be taken by American workers—they will remain vacant, be consolidated, or get offshored to markets where teams are already global. Small employers will lose access to global talent\nLarge companies may absorb the legal cost of H-1B filings. By design, the proposal would push hundreds of thousands of compliant students into new Extension of Stay (EOS) filings with USCIS each year (DHS’s own estimate is ~205,000 EOS requests annually for F-1s alone), adding cost and delay for students, schools, and the government. This is especially acute in STEM graduate education, where international students make up very large shares of enrollment (for example, in certain fields like electrical engineering and computer science). A 4-year cap doesn’t match academic or hiring reality\nGraduate programs in STEM routinely exceed four years. Master’s students who continue into Ph.D. tracks, or who complete STEM OPT after graduation, legally remain in the U.S. for longer periods—adding value through internships, research, and full-time work. Smaller employers—startups, research labs, nonprofits—rely on the F-1 to OPT pathway to evaluate international talent in a legal, performance-based, non-sponsorship model. Constricting their ability to complete long-horizon research will shrink the talent pipeline that feeds U.S. labs, startups, and advanced industries. For these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw the rule and retain a strengthened, data-driven D/S system that protects program integrity without undermining the very research ecosystem that keeps America competitive. As a U.S.-based employer in the technology sector, I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F-1 visa holders and replace it with a fixed-term limit. I write as a current PhD student to urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule.\nApplicability and Overbreadth\n\nThe “one-size-fits-all” structure of this rule fails to distinguish between:\nU.S. degree holders seeking new professional or academic skills (e.g., a Master’s → MBA);\nForeign degree holders pursuing a first U.S. degree at the same level;\nStudents on authorized breaks or gap semesters;\nSTEM OPT workers already approved through vetted training plans (Form I-983);\nPhD students whose multi-year research may require formal academic shifts or continuity;\nProfessional programs (e.g., Education, Law, Social Work, and Business) that attract specialized international applicants. This rule would create unnecessary barriers for students like me who seek advanced education, such as a second master’s degree, to diversify skills and prepare for multiple career paths. Allow sequential and interdisciplinary master’s programs—preserve flexibility for students to pursue additional graduate study when academically justified, rather than restricting them to a single linear academic path. Currently, D/S allows schools’ Designated School Officials (DSOs) to monitor students in SEVIS and grant program extensions when academically justified. Imposing fixed visa terms and additional bureaucratic hurdles will discourage this talent from choosing the United States, redirecting them instead to strategic competitors such as China or to allied nations like Canada and the United Kingdom. I respectfully urge DHS to maintain the D/S policy, thereby preserving the United States’ status as the global leader in education, innovation, and opportunity. I am a graduate of Teachers College, Columbia University, where I earned a Master’s degree in Instructional Technology, and I am currently working under STEM OPT in an education and media role that directly serves underserved immigrant communities in Manhattan’s Chinatown and Flushing. Shrinking this sector harms local economies, particularly in states where public universities rely heavily on international tuition to keep costs affordable for American students. Economic Impact\nInternational students contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy through tuition, housing, and consumer spending. While I share the Department of Homeland Security’s goal of safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system, I urge DHS to reconsider the proposal to eliminate Duration-of-Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. Subject: Opposition to the Elimination of Duration-of-Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 Visas\n\nI write as a concerned American citizen with a professional background in economics and national security. Conclusion\n\nEliminating D/S for F-1 and J-1 visas undermines both America’s economic strength and its national security. Many industries value interdisciplinary training—for example, combining public policy with data science, or business with environmental studies. The flexibility to pursue additional academic training is critical to remaining competitive in this interdisciplinary field. I respectfully urge DHS to:\n\nMaintain the current Duration of Status (D/S) framework;\n\nPreserve the F-1 grace period;\n\nStrengthen existing compliance tools without dismantling a system that works. For these reasons, I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and maintain the current D/S framework, which better serves the interests of all stakeholders. I write to strongly oppose DHS’s proposal to replace the long-standing “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework with a fixed admission period of four years or less. For more than thirty years, the D/S framework has supported the flexibility required by international students and scholars to complete programs, conduct research, and pursue academic training. The D/S framework, managed by trained Designated School Officials (DSOs) who report through SEVIS, is a flexible and effective system for ensuring compliance. In 2023, there were 206,433 international Ph.D. students—15.3% of the total—nearly all of whom would need to file Form I-539 for extensions. While I support program integrity, this rule would create immense burdens for students and institutions, damaging the United States' status as a leader in global education. By creating rigid barriers, this rule risks discouraging top global talent from choosing U.S. institutions, thereby weakening America’s leadership in research, innovation, and higher education. Economic and National Interests\nInternational students contributed $46 billion to the U.S. economy in 2024–25, supporting 400,000 jobs. I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F and J nonimmigrants and replace it with fixed periods of stay. Forcing students to file formal Extension of Stay (EOS) applications with USCIS for normal academic events like changing a major introduces profound anxiety. Requiring frequent extensions of stay (EOS) filings with USCIS will dramatically increase administrative workload for both students and universities. While I understand the government’s goal of ensuring compliance, I believe this rule will bring significant unintended consequences that harm both the United States and its international education community. Finally, reducing the post-completion grace period from 60 to 30 days is punitive and creates severe logistical hardships. NAFSA projects recent visa restrictions may already cost $7 billion and 60,000 jobs this year. I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) proposed rule (2025-16554), which would replace the long-standing “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework for F and J nonimmigrants with fixed admission periods. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing to strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F-1 students and replace it with a fixed period of admission, while also reducing the grace period following completion of study. By limiting F-1 admission to a maximum of four years and shortening the post-completion grace period (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 87–89, §III.B) , DHS would disrupt pathways into Optional Practical Training (OPT) and future employment. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this rule or substantially revise it in favor of targeted, evidence-based approaches that uphold the integrity of the immigration system while preserving the United States’ longstanding leadership in education, research, and innovation. Graduate students and exchange visitors play a central role in U.S. research programs, including those critical to national competitiveness in science and technology. By introducing new barriers, the rule risks reducing access to top global talent and weakening U.S. technological leadership. Retaining duration of status and the existing 60-day grace period is essential to supporting academic integrity, reducing administrative burdens, and preserving the United States’ position as a global leader in higher education and research. Conclusion\n\nThe proposed elimination of Duration of Status would weaken the global standing of U.S. higher education, overburden immigration agencies, disrupt vital research, and impose disproportionate burdens on international students—without sufficient evidence to justify such a fundamental shift. Many international students use the grace period to prepare for Optional Practical Training (OPT), arrange employment, or transition to further study. Increased Administrative and Financial Burdens\nUnder the proposed rule, students would need to apply for extensions through USCIS if their program exceeds the fixed period of admission. Overstay risks can be mitigated through enhanced monitoring, data-sharing, and targeted enforcement, without dismantling a framework that has functioned for decades. Requiring hundreds of thousands of students and exchange visitors to file EOS requests every two to four years will sharply expand USCIS’s workload. Competitive Disadvantage Globally\nCountries such as Canada and the United Kingdom actively welcome international graduates with stable, clear pathways into their labor markets. The United States competes directly with countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia for international students. If the United States adopts restrictive admission policies, top talent will choose alternatives, weakening U.S. companies ability to remain globally competitive. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” My concern with this rule is that it creates unnecessary bureaucracy for both students and the U.S. government, while doing little to enhance oversight or national security. I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace Duration of Status (D/S) with a fixed admission period for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, requiring them to file an Extension of Stay (EOS) application with USCIS to remain in the United States beyond that period. By contrast, the proposed rule would shift this burden to USCIS, requiring students and exchange visitors to file repeated extension-of-stay applications even if they are in good standing. Financial and Administrative Burden\nThe cost of filing Form I-539 for an EOS—currently $370—plus potential legal fees, biometrics appointments, and mailing costs, would place a significant financial burden on students and exchange visitors. As a participant in the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program, I am deeply concerned about the negative impacts this rule would have on millions of legitimate exchange visitors, particularly those in short-term programs such as interns, trainees, researchers, and scholars. By making it more difficult for exchange visitors to complete their programs, the U.S. risks alienating future leaders, researchers, and professionals who would otherwise return home with positive experiences and connections to the United States. As a global talent strategy consultant, I am deeply concerned about the severe competitive disadvantage this rule would create for the United States in the intensifying international competition for high-skilled talent. Recommendation:\nWe urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the current Duration of Status system for F and J nonimmigrants. This proposed rule abandons that successful strategy at precisely the moment when international competition for talent is most intense, virtually guaranteeing that America's competitors will benefit from the human capital we choose to reject.\nDesignated School Officials (DSOs) and Responsible Officers (ROs) already track student enrollment and exchange visitor participation through SEVIS and are required to report changes in status or violations. According to USCIS’s own data, processing times for Form I-539 have ballooned in recent years, often stretching to many months. The UK has reintroduced its Graduate Route visa, providing two years of post-study work authorization. Implementation Challenges\nThe proposed transition period and new requirements for DSOs and sponsors to track and recommend extensions through SEVIS—while also requiring USCIS adjudication—create a dual system that is redundant and prone to error. I recommend implementing a risk-based monitoring system that maintains Duration of Status for students at institutions with strong compliance records while requiring more frequent reporting from higher-risk programs. Adding hundreds of thousands of EOS applications each year would overwhelm the system, leading to prolonged processing times. The proposed rule (2025-16554), particularly the elimination of the “Duration of Status (D/S)” framework, the reduction of the grace period, and the restrictions on extension reasons, will directly affect my ability—and that of many other students—to lawfully remain in the U.S., complete our studies, and fairly pursue employment opportunities. Maintain the 60-day grace period, giving students reasonable time to transition after graduation or OPT. Reducing the grace period to 30 days deprives students of adequate time to secure employment, relocate, or prepare for departure. These unintended consequences suggest that the proposed rule is contrary to U.S. interests, and I urge DHS to reconsider or significantly modify the rule in light of the public comments and the value that international students and exchange visitors bring to this country. Forcing students to leave the country due to a single failed course or research delay will result in the loss of talented individuals. Compared to the current policy, these changes significantly restrict lawful stay conditions for international students. I respectfully urge DHS to reconsider this proposal, maintain the current D/S policy and 60-day grace period, and preserve flexibility in extension reasons. Denying academic difficulties or probation as valid extension reasons ignores the realities of higher education. Many students, especially Ph.D. candidates, require more than four years to complete their programs due to the nature of research or unforeseen circumstances such as health issues. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed rule would impose unnecessary burdens on international students, disrupt U.S. higher education, and reduce America’s competitiveness in attracting global talent. The “cure” seems disproportionate to any purported problem – international students are largely compliant and bring substantial benefits to the U.S. By replacing a proven, flexible D/S system with rigid timelines, the U.S. stands to lose its competitive edge in attracting global talent. Negative impact on universities and the U.S. education system\n\nThe D/S framework has long enabled international students to complete their programs without unnecessary interruptions. Replacing it with fixed terms will require frequent DHS extension requests, burdening both schools and the government with unnecessary administrative tasks. That’s over 400,000 additional applications annually that USCIS must review – a massive increase in workload for an agency already facing processing delays. It also taxes the government’s own resources, forcing DHS to process paperwork for routine progress that previously was handled efficiently through SEVIS monitoring at the school level. However, the economic stakes are high:\n\nAccording to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, international students contributed \\$40.1 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 368,000 jobs in the 2022–23 academic year.

Disrupting even a fraction of these students’ enrollment could reduce tuition revenue and local economic activity. Public Comment on the Proposed Rule \"Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media\"\n\nDocket ID: ICEB-2025-0001\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the current \"duration of status\" (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 student visas with a fixed-term limit. The Undue Burden on International Students\nThe proposed fixed-term limits impose an unnecessary and counterproductive burden on international students, especially those in graduate-level research programs. Replacing it with an arbitrary fixed term will harm international students and, by extension, damage the very ecosystem of innovation and research that the U.S. has built. As noted in a 2024 report from the National Science Board, foreign-born individuals account for a remarkable 43% of all doctorate-level scientists and engineers in the U.S. (see https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20243/talent-u-s-and-global-stem-education-and-labor-force). The median time to complete a U.S. Ph.D. is approximately 5.7 years, according to the 2023 Survey of Earned Doctorates from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (see https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/earned-doctorates/2023#data). Global Competitiveness and Innovation\nThe U.S. has long been a global leader in scientific and technological innovation, a position that is heavily reliant on attracting top-tier international talent. A stable, flexible visa system is not just in the best interest of international students, but is essential for maintaining America’s scientific excellence and global competitiveness. As a recent graduate of a Ph.D. program in Civil Engineering from Rice University, I have first-hand experience with the academic and research process that would be severely jeopardized by this policy. The proposed four-year cap with mandatory extensions creates what economists call \"policy uncertainty shock\" – a phenomenon that demonstrably reduces long-term investment decisions. I urge DHS to withdraw this counterproductive rule and instead pursue targeted reforms that enhance security without sacrificing America's talent magnetism. While security concerns are legitimate, this proposal fundamentally misunderstands how international talent flows operate in today's interconnected economy and will severely damage America's competitive positioning. I recommend instead implementing a \"smart monitoring\" approach: maintain Duration of Status while establishing algorithmic risk scoring based on SEVIS data patterns, institutional compliance history, and program completion rates. Each high-skilled international graduate creates an average of 2.6 additional American jobs through entrepreneurship, research collaboration, and specialized skill transfer (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). They contribute to groundbreaking discoveries, fill essential positions in academia and industry, and enhance the nation's technological and economic competitiveness. The United States built its technological dominance by attracting the world's best minds, not by creating bureaucratic obstacles that push them elsewhere. Duration of Status ties lawful presence to enrollment and SEVIS oversight by Designated School Officials. The Department of Homeland Security’s proposal to replace the long-standing Duration of Status framework with fixed admission periods poses serious risks to students, universities, employers, and the U.S. economy. Duration of Status already provides accountability through SEVIS oversight while supporting flexibility for students and institutions. It discourages top international talent, disrupts U.S. universities’ ability to deliver world-class research, and reduces the pool of highly skilled graduates available to American employers. For these reasons, I strongly urge DHS to reconsider these provisions and adopt policies that both safeguard immigration integrity and preserve America’s position as the premier destination for global talent. The result will be fewer highly skilled graduates with the breadth of knowledge U.S. employers need to remain competitive globally. Conclusion\nThe United States has long maintained its global leadership in innovation and higher education by attracting the world’s best students. The United States has long been the world’s leader in higher education because it offers stability and opportunity.\nFour-Year I-94 Cap Harms U.S. Research and Innovation\nPhD programs, particularly in STEM fields, typically require 5–6 years to complete, and humanities/social sciences often require even longer. Master’s → Optional Practical Training → Ph.D. Students who progress naturally through these stages could see lawful programs disrupted by mid-degree filing delays, undermining research and teaching. Maintaining lawful pathways for same-level study when academically distinct or necessary for family unity, career pivots, or practical training. The proposed rule destabilizes lawful, compliant pathways and harms the very individuals who contribute most to U.S. research, innovation, and the economy. The proposed rule’s prohibition on pursuing additional degrees or changing academic levels ignores the dynamic demands of the modern economy. Restricting Second Degrees or Degree Changes Ignores Workforce Realities\nModern industries require interdisciplinary expertise. Preventing second Master’s degrees for career changes deprives the economy of talent. I am writing to strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F-1 students and replace it with admission until a fixed end date (capped at four years). Imposing a 4-year cap on initial admission would make it inevitable that most PhD students will require multiple extensions of stay. Administrative Burdens and Delays\n\nUnder the proposed rule, students would be forced to file USCIS extensions of stay (EOS)—including biometrics collection—merely to finish their degree. While the stated purpose is to enhance program integrity and immigration oversight, the practical effect will be to disrupt U.S. higher education and place untenable burdens on international students, universities, and government agencies. This contradicts DHS’s responsibility to administer immigration benefits efficiently. Negative Impact on U.S. Competitiveness\n\nThe U.S. remains a global leader in higher education and innovation largely because it attracts and retains top international scholars. PhD Programs Frequently Exceed Four Years\n\nPhD programs in the United States, especially in STEM fields, typically last 5–7 years on average, often longer when factoring in dissertation research, fieldwork, or teaching commitments. USCIS already struggles with significant backlogs; for example, average processing times for benefits such as OPT have ranged from 3–5 months in recent years [2]. Imposing restrictive timelines signals to prospective PhD candidates that the U.S. cannot guarantee stability during their studies. The National Science Foundation (NSF) reports that the median time to degree for doctoral recipients in science and engineering fields is more than 6 years [1]. Reducing the attractiveness of U.S. doctoral programs undermines long-term national competitiveness in science, technology, and research. References:\n\n[1] “Survey of Earned Doctorates: Median Time to Degree of Doctorate Recipients,” National Science Foundation (NSF). This creates unnecessary administrative bottlenecks, delays research progress, and undermines U.S. universities’ ability to attract global talent. Unlawful Presence Consequences Are Disproportionate\n\nUnder the proposed change, overstaying a fixed I-94 date—even by administrative error or a delayed extension filing—would immediately trigger unlawful presence, potentially leading to 3- or 10-year bars to reentry. First, the proposal would create an immense and unnecessary administrative burden on U.S. The proposal to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) would severely undermine the United States’ long-term national development across education, science, technology, healthcare, and industry. Similarly, Stripe, founded by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, emerged from U.S. higher education networks and has become one of the world’s leading fintech companies. This directly harms middle-class families and reduces access to affordable higher education. As an international PhD student currently studying in the United States, I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to eliminate the Duration of Status (D/S) framework for F, J, and I visa holders. For example, Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO, from India) and Sundar Pichai (Google CEO, from India) once relied on student visas. The change harms student mental health and academic progress. In conclusion, eliminating D/S will not merely inconvenience international students; it will directly harm the American people by weakening our universities, slowing scientific breakthroughs, worsening healthcare shortages, reducing innovation, and shrinking job creation. If these students face rigid visa timelines instead of D/S flexibility, enrollment will decline, resulting in tuition shortfalls that will force public universities to cut faculty positions, reduce research budgets, and increase tuition for American students. In the technology sector, giants like Microsoft, Google, and Tesla thrive on talent pipelines that include international graduates. If the fixed-period framework must be pursued, I suggest the following amendments:\n\t•\tAllow an initial 5-year admission period for PhD programs;\n\t•\tPermit graduate-level program transfers in cases of verified academic or financial hardship;\n\t•\tClarify the permissibility of Master’s-level “opt-out” (Master out) paths within doctoral programs;\n\t•\tEnsure the EOS (Extension of Stay) process is streamlined and not punitive. For instance, Elon Musk, originally from South Africa, founded Tesla and SpaceX, companies that now employ tens of thousands of U.S. workers. A fixed four-year limit does not reflect the reality of research-based doctoral programs, which commonly extend to 5–7 years. Losing such talent not only slows our national progress in science and industry but also risks ceding leadership to global competitors. Second, America’s leadership in science and technology depends on retaining international researchers. If the U.S. drives away global talent, we risk not only losing economic contributions but also weakening our alliances and global influence, while strengthening the very nations that compete with us strategically. I respectfully submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (Docket No. I submit this comment in strong opposition to DHS’s proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (Docket No. Administrative Burdens and Risk of Violations\n\nForcing all students and exchange visitors to apply for extensions, even when they are in full compliance, will overwhelm immigration offices, cause delays, and increase costs. ⸻\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed rule will not meaningfully deter visa misuse, but it will create inequity, harm workforce development, undermine national STEM initiatives, and tarnish America’s global reputation. While DHS frames the proposal as an effort to increase accountability, the rule in fact introduces inequities, uncertainty, and systemic disadvantages that will weaken America’s position in global education and innovation. Conclusion\n\nThis rule would disrupt education, overburden immigration services, reduce America’s global competitiveness, and restrict freedom of the press. While I understand the government's desire to address visa-related issues, I believe this proposal is fundamentally flawed and will have significant negative consequences for U.S. higher education, research, and global competitiveness. Research may require extended experiments, fieldwork, or revisions, and the proposed four-year maximum would prevent many students from finishing their work on time. Forcing them into recurring immigration filings introduces instability into research projects, delays in federally funded labs, and potential violations of grant timelines. DHS should withdraw the rule and instead strengthen existing targeted enforcement tools that preserve both security and competitiveness. Rigid limits hinder press freedom and risk reciprocal restrictions on U.S. reporters abroad, undermining democratic values. •\tTargeted enforcement against non-compliant individuals rather than blanket restrictions. Disruption to Academic Programs\n\nThe current “duration of status” system allows students and scholars to complete programs without unnecessary interruptions. Misguided Approach to a Specific Problem\nI understand that this proposal is likely aimed at addressing issues such as Day-1 CPT abuse. A more appropriate and targeted approach would involve strengthening the regulations and oversight of specific programs or practices. It also bans international students from beginning another program at the same or lower level after completion and imposes a 24-month aggregate cap on English-language training. •\tThe 24-month cap on language training ignores academic realities, since many intensive programs with breaks can exceed this limit. Unreasonable restrictions on student options\n\t•\tThe ban on same- or lower-level study harms community colleges, certificate programs, and career-changers. Conclusion\n\nThis proposed rule imposes excessive costs, risks, and restrictions on international students and the schools and employers that rely on them. Core concerns\n\nThe rule would replace “duration of status” (D/S) with a fixed admission period (generally up to four years) and require frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) filings with USCIS. The proposed restrictions particularly endanger English-language programs and community colleges, which are disproportionately reliant on international enrollment. The rule would damage U.S. higher education, harm freedom of the press, and undermine a vital export industry. Many Americans return to higher education to change fields or add new skills, and international students should not be barred from doing the same. It jeopardizes a sector that contributes nearly $44 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. A record 242,782 students participated in OPT in 2023–24, forming a vital part of the entry-level STEM and professional workforce. National and local economic impacts\n\nInternational students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported ~378,000 jobs in 2023–24. If the concern is excessive use of Optional Practical Training (OPT), then it would be far more reasonable to restrict OPT use to one time per degree level rather than deny students the chance to study further.\nStates and local communities benefit from the presence of international students, who contribute billions of dollars and support hundreds of thousands of American jobs. By making study in the United States more difficult, this rule will drive students elsewhere, hurting U.S. institutions and workers alike. It also undermines the United States’ reputation as the top destination for global talent. By shifting lawful presence from status-based D/S to a hard I-94 date, the rule raises the risk that adjudication delays, mail glitches, or good-faith filing errors convert compliant students and scholars into accrual of unlawful presence and potential three or ten-year bars—penalties grossly disproportionate to administrative timing issues.

Good-faith EOS filers should receive clear status protection after denial for a short, fixed period to prevent inadvertent unlawful-presence accrual; where delays are agency-caused, unlawful presence should be tolled. Replacing D/S with fixed end-dates for all F, J, and I nonimmigrants, shortening the F-1 grace period from 60 to 30 days, and routing continued stay through mandatory USCIS extension-of-stay filings would impose large, recurring costs while offering no monetized benefits and little evidence that the same oversight goals cannot be achieved by less burdensome means.

The NPRM also introduces differential treatment for I-visa holders with PRC passports (90-day admission/extension versus 240 days for others) without publishing current, data-driven evidence that such a country-specific limit is necessary and proportionate. It authorizes biometrics collection at EOS and caps language-training at 24 months (including breaks), yet provides no detailed privacy impact assessment or evidence that a hard cap improves outcomes relative to accredited, longer curricula. It authorizes biometrics collection at EOS and caps language-training at 24 months (including breaks), yet provides no detailed privacy impact assessment or evidence that a hard cap improves outcomes relative to accredited, longer curricula. For currently admitted D/S students approaching completion, DHS should codify a grandfathering path that lets them finish programs and commence OPT (including STEM OPT) without an interim EOS triggered solely by the new framework. The one-size “up to four years” cap ignores normal time-to-degree in many PhD, MD, and joint programs and will force predictable waves of EOS filings unrelated to compliance risk, adding fees, legal exposure, and uncertainty. The one-size “up to four years” cap ignores normal time-to-degree in many PhD, MD, and joint programs and will force predictable waves of EOS filings unrelated to compliance risk, adding fees, legal exposure, and uncertainty. A targeted alternative would retain D/S but add risk-based triggers: SEVIS anomalies or defined compliance red flags would prompt direct DHS review or EOS, while compliant students and scholars continue without duplicate filings. The proposal externalizes major workload to universities and sponsors and to USCIS without a concrete resourcing plan or service-level guarantees; the likely result is larger backlogs, not better screening. The proposal externalizes major workload to universities and sponsors and to USCIS without a concrete resourcing plan or service-level guarantees; the likely result is larger backlogs, not better screening. USCIS and SEVP require funded staffing, SEVIS-to-USCIS data pipes, and public service-level targets before any mass EOS mandate. Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nI respectfully submit this comment to oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media (RIN: 1653-AA80). Legal and Administrative Burden\n\nImplementing this restriction will create significant administrative burdens for schools and USCIS officers, while generating confusion for current students caught mid-program. This could lead to lawsuits under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for being arbitrary, capricious, and lacking a rational connection between facts and the sweeping restrictions proposed. While I acknowledge DHS’s intent to enhance program integrity, I have significant concerns about the proposed restrictions that prohibit F-1 students from pursuing a program at the same or lower educational level after completing a higher degree (e.g., pursuing a master’s degree after earning a doctorate). Many professionals pursue additional master’s degrees to transition into new fields (e.g., an engineering PhD later seeking a business degree, or a medical doctor pursuing public health). Restricting legitimate second-degree pathways will directly harm U.S. universities, especially graduate programs (MBA, data science, public policy, etc.) Negative Impact on Academic Freedom and Career Flexibility\n\nAcademic and career pathways are not always linear. Barring such transitions undermines the principle of academic freedom and denies talented individuals the flexibility to adapt to evolving labor market needs. According to NAFSA, international students contributed over $40 billion in the 2022–23 academic year. Universities and the Economy\n\nInternational students contribute billions of dollars annually to U.S. higher education and local economies. To Whom It May Concern,\nI am submitting this comment as an F-1 international student who has lived, studied, and contributed to life in the United States for several years. I write to express strong concern about the proposed DHS rule ICEB-2025-0001, particularly the change from \"duration of status\" (D/S) to fixed admission periods and the reduction of the post-completion grace period from 60 days to 30 days. that rely on diverse student backgrounds, including those with prior advanced degrees. A “one-size-fits-all” prohibition unfairly punishes thousands of bona fide students for the actions of a small minority. Existing Oversight Mechanisms Are Sufficient\n\nSEVIS and Designated School Officials (DSOs) already review degree progress, issue I-20s, and monitor compliance. It does not account for:\n\t•\tPhD and research programs that routinely exceed 4–6 years;\n\t•\tProfessional programs with required internships or licensing timelines;\n\t•\tStudents with health issues or gap semesters;\n\t•\tTransfer students or those changing majors;\n\t•\tOPT/STEM OPT participants, whose lawful stay is tied to completing degree requirements. This risk is especially acute for students in programs with non-standard timelines, such as research-intensive master’s or PhD degrees, as well as professional students whose completion may depend on internships or practicum requirements. Educational Disruption and Academic Freedom \n\nAcademic timelines vary widely, particularly for graduate programs, thesis defenses, research extensions, and cooperative training. Conflict with Existing Statutory and Regulatory Framework \n\nUnder INA § 101(a)(15)(F), (J), and (I), Congress has not imposed fixed admission terms; instead, it has authorized admission “for the purpose” of pursuing a course of study, cultural exchange, or media activity. §§ 1103 and 1184 as authority, I believe the proposed regulatory changes are inconsistent with longstanding statutory and regulatory frameworks, undermine Congressional intent, and would impose severe negative consequences on students, exchange visitors, institutions, and the U.S. economy. I write in strong opposition to the proposed DHS rule that would eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F-1 students and instead impose a fixed admission period. The proposed rule would disrupt education, arbitrarily restrict academic freedom, burden institutions, and harm U.S. competitiveness, all without statutory mandate or meaningful evidence of benefit. The existing 60-day grace period has been in place for decades, balancing administrative oversight with practical realities. Personal Impact\nThe proposed rule would disrupt my education and career planning. At minimum, DHS should:\n\t•\tRetain D/S as the standard admission period for F-1 students;\n\t•\tProvide clear exemptions for long-term programs such as PhDs;\n\t•\tEnsure protections for students on OPT/STEM OPT;\n\t•\tConduct a full economic and administrative impact assessment before finalization. For employers, uncertainty about whether a student can lawfully complete a program or continue OPT/STEM OPT authorization creates additional compliance risks, reducing hiring of international talent. Employers already hesitate to hire international students due to visa complexity; adding further uncertainty about lawful stay during OPT or STEM OPT will discourage opportunities even more. Adding instability through fixed timelines will discourage prospective students from choosing U.S. institutions, driving them to competitor countries like Canada, the U.K., or Australia, which offer clearer and more stable visa frameworks. The proposed fixed timeline, however, forces students into constant uncertainty: if a program takes longer than anticipated, I could be required to file extensions or even depart the country mid-degree. Replacing it with fixed timelines creates unnecessary burdens, legal risks, and economic harm. I am writing to oppose the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n\nThis proposal introduces significant problems that extend beyond administrative burden, and I urge DHS to withdraw it for the following reasons:\n\nNegative Impact on Mental Health and Academic Success\nInternational students and exchange visitors already face unique challenges—adjusting to a new culture, language barriers, and academic pressure.\nThousands of students and exchange visitors came to the United States under the assurance that lawful presence would be tied to program compliance, not to arbitrary visa end dates. Conclusion:\nThe United States should be making it easier—not harder—for international students, exchange visitors, and information media representatives to study, teach, and contribute here. I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to DHS’s proposed rule DHS-2025-0250-0001, which would eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant visa holders. I am submitting this comment to express my strong opposition to the DHS proposed rule that would replace “duration of status” with fixed admission periods for F-1 and J-1 students. For decades, this authority has been exercised by permitting F-1 and J-1 students and exchange visitors to remain for the duration of their program, subject to continuous compliance with status requirements. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this rule and maintain the longstanding D/S system, which has proven effective in advancing both national security and America’s global competitiveness. This proposed rule adds instability, discourages enrollment, and undermines our ability to attract top global talent. For these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this rule. It conflicts with the structure of the Immigration and Nationality Act, imposes substantial economic costs, damages U.S. strategic interests, and undermines settled reliance expectations. This talent diversion undermines the United States’ ability to remain globally competitive, particularly in advanced research fields where Chinese universities are rapidly gaining ground. The United States should continue to uphold policies that attract, rather than repel, the world’s best students, while using targeted enforcement tools against genuine risks. The costs and risks of repeated filings fall hardest on students with limited resources or those from countries with long consular wait times. While the stated goal is improved oversight, this policy would have the opposite effect: it would burden students, universities, and USCIS alike, while undermining the very strengths of U.S. higher education. Forcing talented researchers to reapply for stay extensions mid-project interrupts continuity and risks undermining research funded by U.S. taxpayers, foundations, or government grants. For these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and retain the current “Duration of Status (D/S)” framework, which better reflects the realities of U.S. higher education and supports the nation’s long-term interests. Conclusion\nThe proposed fixed-duration rule would disrupt research, weaken U.S. innovation, increase administrative inefficiency, and harm both higher education and the economy. I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would replace the Duration of Status (D/S) framework with a fixed-term period of admission. Conflict with U.S. Higher Education and Economic Interests\nInternational students contribute tens of billions of dollars annually in tuition and local spending, supporting both universities and surrounding communities. This proposed rule would likely lead to a substantial decrease in international student enrollment, resulting in severe negative consequences across multiple sectors of the U.S. economy. In today's interdisciplinary job market, it is increasingly common for individuals to pursue multiple degrees in different fields to stay competitive. In summary, while I understand the intention to improve oversight and streamline immigration procedures, the current proposal risks significant unintended harm to the United States’ global academic standing, its economy, and the integrity of its immigration system. I respectfully submit the following comments:\n\nInternational students contribute significantly to the United States. The United States has built its global academic leadership in large part by attracting top international talent to its doctoral programs. Data from the National Science Foundation indicates that 68% of STEM Ph.D. recipients require 5.7 years on average to complete their degrees, with biomedical sciences averaging 6.2 years. Most Ph.D. programs, particularly in STEM fields, require 5–6 years to complete. Alternatively, create tiered admission periods—six years for doctoral programs, four years for master's degrees, with streamlined renewal processes managed through digital platforms. Increased Burden on USCIS and Immigration System\nRequiring I-539 filings every few years will generate unnecessary bureaucracy, create massive USCIS backlogs, and reduce efficiency. Requiring hundreds of thousands of F, J, and I visa holders to file Form I-539 annually for extensions of stay would overwhelm USCIS and further exacerbate processing backlogs. Moreover, Designated School Officials (DSOs) would experience increased administrative pressure, which could reduce the overall efficiency and quality of support provided to students. ---\n\nReferences:\nNAFSA / JB International, “International Students Contribute Record-breaking Level of Spending and 378,000 Jobs to the U.S. Economy during the 2023-2024 Academic Year.” ([NAFSA][1])\nNCSES / Survey of Earned Doctorates (2023), median PhD time: 5.7 years from doctoral program entry; 7.2 years from grad school entry; \\~8.6 years from bachelor’s degree. ([Bestcolleges.com][2])\n• Many STEM and research-intensive programs require more than four years; a four-year cap will force frequent extension requests, disrupt research, delay graduation, threaten funding, and penalize students in fields with unpredictable timelines. I oppose the proposed rule (ICEB-2025-0001-0001) replacing Duration of Status (D/S) for F-1/J-1 students with a fixed four-year admission period and stricter limits on field/degree changes, extensions, and additional degrees. b. Misalignment with Real PhD / STEM / Research Timelines\n• According to 2023 data (Survey of Earned Doctorates, NCSES), the median time from entering the doctoral program to PhD award is **5.7 years**. I urge DHS to preserve flexibility, align admission periods with actual program durations, avoid rigid caps that ignore variation, and include strong safeguards to prevent unintended harms. A Solution in Search of a Problem\nThe rule's justification—that F and J visa holders have a high overstay rate—is false, according to DHS's own data. International students and exchange visitors are a major American \"export,\" contributing $43.8 billion to the economy and supporting over 378,000 American jobs in the 2023-2024 academic year. Economic Impact\n• In the 2023-2024 academic year, international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed about **US \\$43.8 billion** to the U.S. economy and supported **378,175 jobs**. Economic Loss: A potential 15% decline in international student enrollment could result in a $7 billion loss to the U.S. economy and the elimination of over 60,000 jobs. c. Administrative Burden, Delay & Risk of Status Loss\n• More frequent extension filings will increase workload for USCIS/SEVP, which already exhibit delays and resource constraints. • Ensure USCIS / SEVP have sufficient staffing, funding, and processing capacity *before* implementing new limits, to avoid backlogs and unintended status loss. • Include robust grace/buffer periods and protections for students facing legitimate delays (health, lab/advisor changes, funding interruptions, etc.). Conclusion\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the rule risks harming students, undermining U.S. higher education and research, weakening local and national economies, and reducing America’s ability to attract global talent. • Rigid caps and restrictions make the U.S. less attractive relative to countries with more flexible student visa systems, risking loss of talent, reduced research output, and weakened global standing. • Fields such as humanities, field sciences, interdisciplinary research often have unpredictable timelines; uniform caps do not reflect this variation. Conclusion\nIn summary, the proposed rule would disrupt U.S. research and innovation, increase USCIS backlogs, damage higher education and local economies, and impose disproportionate penalties on students—all without clear security benefits. Introduction\nI write as someone who has studied and worked closely in the higher education and research sector, where international students—especially in STEM fields—are essential to sustaining America’s innovation capacity. Finally, restrictive policies reduce America’s global attractiveness, weakening both national security and foreign policy influence by pushing talent toward competitor nations. Background\nThe proposed rule replaces the long-standing “duration of status” (D/S) admission for F-1 students with a fixed four-year term, requiring frequent extensions of stay (EOS) through Form I-539. Replacing D/S with fixed-term admissions and frequent extension requirements would undermine U.S. competitiveness, weaken our higher education system, and harm national interests. Each extension filing represents not just the $370 I-539 fee, but also legal consultation costs averaging $1,500-3,000, program interruption risks, and employer hesitation during pending applications. I respectfully recommend that DHS:\nWithdraw the fixed four-year term proposal;\nRetain the duration of status framework; and\nExplore targeted oversight measures that preserve U.S. competitiveness and security. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and develop evidence-based alternatives that maintain America's competitive position in global talent acquisition. Recommendations\nI urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and retain the D/S framework. Economic Harm to American Communities\n\nInternational students contributed approximately $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2023–24 academic year and supported over 370,000 American jobs (NAFSA, IIE). Imposing fixed-term limits with high-frequency extension filings will shrink this sector, reduce revenues for U.S. institutions, and harm the American workers and communities that rely on these expenditures. Economic harm: According to NAFSA, international students contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support more than 400,000 jobs. Strategic Competition and National Security\n\nThe United States’ comparative advantage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has long depended on attracting and retaining the world’s brightest students and researchers.\nThe elimination of Duration of Status will weaken U.S. higher education, undercut our STEM advantage, and hand strategic benefits to competitors abroad. Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia have all expanded post-study work rights. For these reasons, the proposed rule is likely to harm the U.S. economy, overburden immigration processes, weaken higher education, and diminish the nation’s ability to attract global talent. The United States currently hosts over one million international students, who contribute significantly to job creation, tax revenues, and the financial stability of higher education institutions. Strategic Competition and National Security:\nThe United States’ greatest advantage in its competition with China and other rivals is its ability to attract and retain the best minds from around the world. Requiring hundreds of thousands of F and J visa holders to file EOS applications every two to four years would flood the agency with millions of new filings. I respectfully oppose provisions of the proposed rule (ICEB-2025-0001) that would eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F and J visa holders and replace it with a fixed admission period. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw or substantially revise the proposal and to pursue targeted, evidence-driven alternatives that safeguard the immigration system without damaging U.S. national interests. Requiring hundreds of thousands of students to file Form I-539 extensions annually would place unsustainable pressure on USCIS resources, further exacerbate existing backlogs, and impose additional responsibilities on Designated School Officials. Instead of eliminating D/S altogether, DHS should strengthen existing monitoring tools and apply narrowly tailored measures where problems are demonstrated, rather than imposing across-the-board restrictions that punish compliant students and institutions. This would worsen existing backlogs, delay decisions for both students and other applicants, and further erode public confidence in the system. Removing it will create uncertainty, deter enrollment, and push top talent toward countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, which are actively expanding their student visa programs. Talent Drain and Global Competition:\nCanada’s post-study work permits, the UK’s Graduate Route, and Australia’s research visa pathways are already drawing talented students who might otherwise have come to the U.S. Forcing them into repeated EOS filings risks disrupting research milestones, undermining collaboration, and weakening America’s global position in innovation. In conclusion, the proposed rule would undermine U.S. higher education, overload the immigration system, and unfairly burden international students, all without a sound evidentiary basis. Universities compete worldwide for top talent, and frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) applications would create new costs, uncertainty, and administrative barriers. By imposing arbitrary expiration dates and red tape, this proposal instead risks driving those innovators abroad—where they will contribute to foreign economies and strategic competitors. I respectfully submit this comment to oppose key provisions of the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule ending “Duration of Status” (D/S) admissions for F-1 (students), J-1 (exchange visitors), and I-1 (foreign media) nonimmigrants. Conclusion\nThe proposed DHS rule ending Duration of Status for F, J, and I nonimmigrants is a step backward for U.S. higher education and immigration policy. I am an international student currently on F-1 OPT, and I write to express my strong opposition to this proposed rule. Restricting Academic Mobility Undermines Student Opportunity and U.S. Institutions\nThe proposed rule would bar F-1 undergraduates from changing programs or majors during their first academic year and prohibit students from enrolling in a second degree at the same or lower academic level, except in rare circumstances. Restrictions on Academic Freedom and Educational Mobility\n\nThe proposed rule prohibits graduate students from changing majors midway, restricts transfers, and bans pursuing programs at the same academic level. Forcing students into repeated extensions will create unnecessary uncertainty for them and add thousands of new filings to USCIS each year, exacerbating delays and administrative backlogs. I urge DHS to withdraw or substantially revise these provisions to preserve the flexibility that has long made the United States the world’s premier destination for higher education and talent. Contrary to the Long-Term Interests of the United States\n\nMany international students remain in the U.S. after graduation, contributing to research, innovation, and entrepreneurship—areas that are vital to America’s technological and economic leadership. As someone who has studied in the United States for years and is now in the difficult process of finding employment, I know firsthand how much uncertainty already exists for international students and graduates. This new proposal would add even more obstacles by replacing the current “duration of status” system with fixed expiration dates and forcing students to repeatedly apply for extensions. Restricting us through arbitrary time limits does not make the system stronger; it only drives away people who want to stay here legally and give back. Increased Administrative Burden and Risk of Arbitrary Decisions\n\nRequiring students to apply for extensions every four years—or even sooner—will significantly increase USCIS backlogs and slow adjudication processes, potentially leading to more cases of unintentional overstays. Having represented many international students and scholars in immigration matters, I believe these changes would undermine the U.S. higher education system, burden government agencies, and close doors to valuable global talent. Closing the Door to Interdisciplinary Talents Harms U.S. Competitiveness\nAs an immigration lawyer, I have helped many outstanding talents secure immigrant petitions based on extraordinary ability or national interest. - Prohibiting multiple or same-level degrees closes the door to interdisciplinary talents who have historically driven U.S. innovation and global leadership. We urge DHS to retain Duration of Status (D/S), maintain the 60-day grace period, avoid retroactive application, and streamline existing oversight mechanisms rather than imposing new administrative burdens. The proposed rule seeks to replace the long-standing Duration of Status (D/S) admission framework with a fixed admission period of up to 4 years, require extensions of stay (EOS), shorten grace periods, and restrict academic program changes\n. Federal Register\n\nReducing the post-completion grace period from 60 to 30 days will trigger avoidable departures, rushed moves, and housing/flight penalties without demonstrable integrity gains. Federal Register\n\nRestrictions on transfers and program changes—requiring undergraduates to complete the first academic year before transferring, barring graduate students from changing programs at any point, and prohibiting moves to the same or lower level—are overly rigid and disconnect policy from real academic pathways (e.g., changing advisors, lab closures, funding shifts, or academic/health needs). Federal Register\n\nThe proposal would cap English-language study at 24 months and ties its justification to abuses by a minority, yet the rule would penalize a broad population of bona fide students and programs that already meet ED-recognized accreditation requirements. NAFSA\n+1\n\nConclusion\n\nI support DHS’s integrity goals, but the proposal’s fixed-term admissions, language-study cap, and rigid transfer rules are overbroad and counterproductive. Summary of Concerns\n\nEnding D/S and imposing a fixed-time admission (max 4 years) will create substantial new adjudication backlogs and uncertainty for bona fide students, with little added integrity benefit. NAFSA\n+1\naau.edu\n\nEvidence and Context\n\nDHS’s own history section acknowledges D/S increased efficiency by reducing repetitive extensions; SEVIS now provides real-time tracking, DSO reporting, and status controls—the integrity tools that did not exist in 1978–1991. While the intent to improve oversight and strengthen compliance is understandable, several provisions risk causing disproportionate harm to international students, U.S. universities, and the country’s ability to retain global talent. Alternative Approaches\nWhile DHS cites fraud prevention and national security concerns, SEVIS already provides real-time monitoring of students. Limiting F-1 status to 4 years, combined with the removal of D/S, will introduce uncertainty and unnecessary administrative burden for doctoral students who are vital contributors to U.S. research and development\n. Repeated visa stamping and extensions\nRequiring multiple visa renewals during long programs will create significant administrative burden both for students and DHS. Impact analysis: Before finalizing, DHS should quantify added adjudication volume and costs of EOS filings, and model enrollment/economic impacts using publicly available data (NAFSA, SEVIS, AAU). Economic Costs and Competitiveness\nDHS’s own estimate places the annualized cost of this rule at over $390 million across students, schools, and program sponsors\n. These costs will deter international enrollment, weakening U.S. universities financially and pushing top talent to competitor countries (Canada, UK, Australia) that are actively liberalizing student visa policies. This rule will impose unnecessary burdens on students and universities, reduce the competitiveness of U.S. higher education, and discourage international talent from choosing the United States. This proposed rule would cause significant financial losses, destabilize program planning, and reduce the global standing of U.S. higher education. Academic paths are rarely linear; limiting students’ ability to adapt their studies or pursue advanced programs ignores the realities of higher education and global knowledge exchange. By reducing flexibility, adding new administrative burdens, and discouraging international enrollment, this proposal would result in major losses of tuition revenue and diminish the global competitiveness of U.S. universities. A decline in international enrollment translates directly into substantial tuition revenue losses, weakening our ability to fund faculty, programs, and research that benefit all students. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead pursue narrower, evidence-based reforms that protect national security without undermining America’s universities. Executive Summary\nAs a university administrator, I strongly oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants.\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed DHS rule that would eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with fixed admission periods. Forcing additional extension of stay (EOS) applications adds duplicative oversight, creates uncertainty, and risks pushing otherwise compliant students out of lawful status due to processing delays. Disruption to Academic Programs\nThe proposed four-year admission cap for F and J studentsfails to account for longer graduate degrees, medical residencies, research projects, and multi-phase exchange programs. Students forced to file repeated extension requests risk interruptions in their studies and research. Research projects, program structures, and fieldwork timelines often extend beyond arbitrary limits. While DHS frames this proposal as oversight, its effect would be to discourage universities from authorizing CPT and prevent students from gaining the hands-on training that makes U.S. education globally competitive. By forcing fixed stays and shifting extension authority to USCIS, this rule will complicate or even restrict CPT access. Practical Alternatives\nRather than eliminating D/S, DHS should:\n\nMaintain D/S admissions, using targeted compliance reviews for flagged cases rather than blanket EOS requirements. If DHS insists on fixed periods, create automatic, DSO-confirmed status extensions within SEVIS (no USCIS filing) when a student remains in good standing; align any status end date with OPT/STEM-OPT and the cap-gap window to avoid artificial gaps. Dear DHS,\n\nI am deeply concerned about the proposed amendment under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(ii)(C), which would prohibit F-1 students from enrolling in a second master’s degree program in the United States. The rule would force mid-program USCIS filings—introducing adjudication risk unrelated to student merit or compliance. U.S. policy recognizes that graduates need time to start work and change status; that’s why we have OPT, STEM-OPT, and a cap-gap bridge to H-1B. USCIS itself explains the 12-month OPT, the 24-month STEM-OPT, and the cap-gap bridge (now extended to as late as April 1)—policies built precisely because graduates need a predictable buffer between school and work. The opportunity for students to pursue a second master’s degree provides more certainty and predictability in the OPT pipeline, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared and able to start working without unnecessary delays. I oppose the proposed rule that replaces admission for Duration of Status (D/S) with fixed, date-certain periods (capped at four years) and reduces the F-1 grace period from 60 to 30 days. The rule would end D/S and require students and exchange visitors to file extensions with USCIS if their studies, training, or research run beyond a fixed period; it would also cut the F-1 grace period to 30 days. Compressing admission and grace periods conflicts with these programs’ real-world timelines, increases inadvertent status violations, and creates needless uncertainty for new hires. This proposal also overlooks an important point: current regulations already make it difficult for international students to pursue advanced degrees such as a Juris Doctor (JD) or PhD after a master’s program, even when those are the natural next steps for their academic or career development. If both higher-level programs and second master’s degrees are restricted, international students are left with almost no educational pathway in the United States. It would also discourage future international students from choosing American universities, weakening our higher education sector and reducing the skilled talent pool available to U.S. employers. The changes would harm students, universities, employers, and the U.S. innovation economy—especially in strategically critical fields like AI and the internet—without delivering commensurate oversight benefits. If the U.S. reduces time to stay or adds adjudication hurdles mid-program, the global “study-and-stay” calculus shifts away from America—especially for AI, software, and internet graduates who can work anywhere. A second master’s degree is often the most effective way to acquire the skills needed to succeed in American industries—for example, shifting from a purely academic background into applied fields such as data science, business analytics, or public policy. To Whom It May Concern,\n\nAs the founder of a technology startup based in New York City, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule under Docket ICEB-2025-0001, which seeks to replace the “duration of status” framework for F, J, and I visa holders with fixed admission periods. To Whom It May Concern,\n\nAs the founder of a technology startup based in New York City, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule under Docket ICEB-2025-0001, which seeks to replace the “duration of status” framework for F, J, and I visa holders with fixed admission periods. Replacing this with a rigid, fixed admission period introduces uncertainty and risk. Under the proposed rule, a student working on a groundbreaking AI model or a journalist documenting a long-form investigation could be forced to leave the country midstream simply because their visa expired—even if they’re still actively engaged in their approved program. Under the proposed rule, a student working on a groundbreaking AI model or a journalist documenting a long-form investigation could be forced to leave the country midstream simply because their visa expired—even if they’re still actively engaged in their approved program. It forces talented individuals to navigate frequent extension requests, which can delay projects, disrupt teams, and discourage participation in long-term initiatives. Startups Thrive on Global Talent\n\nMy company, like many others in New York’s vibrant tech scene, depends on the contributions of international students, researchers, and exchange visitors. Startups Thrive on Global Talent\n\nMy company, like many others in New York’s vibrant tech scene, depends on the contributions of international students, researchers, and exchange visitors. They studied at top universities, participated in research collaborations, and joined startups like mine to gain hands-on experience. If enacted, this rule will make it harder for startups to recruit talent, harder for universities to attract top students, and harder for foreign media professionals to report on American life. If enacted, this rule will make it harder for startups to recruit talent, harder for universities to attract top students, and harder for foreign media professionals to report on American life. This rule is not only unnecessary—it’s actively harmful to innovation, entrepreneurship, and the global talent pipeline that fuels the American startup ecosystem. Startups, universities, and media organizations will have to dedicate time and resources to navigating these changes—resources that could be better spent on innovation, education, and public service. Startups, universities, and media organizations will have to dedicate time and resources to navigating these changes—resources that could be better spent on innovation, education, and public service. For startups, where timelines are tight and resources are limited, this kind of instability is a serious liability. I respectfully submit this comment to strongly oppose the proposed rule titled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n\nThis rule would have serious negative consequences for international students, exchange visitors, and U.S. institutions of higher education. The current “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework has functioned effectively for decades by allowing international students and exchange visitors to remain lawfully admitted as long as they pursue their program and comply with regulations. Unnecessary Burden on Students and Institutions\nAcademic programs, research projects, and exchange opportunities often extend beyond arbitrary fixed timeframes. While I understand DHS’s concern about program misuse, this rule is overly broad, impractical, and harmful to the interests of the United States in four key areas: economic impact, higher education sustainability, STEM talent competitiveness, and academic flexibility. Loss of Academic Flexibility and Student Choice\nThe proposed rule also states:\n\n“DHS proposes to restrict school transfers and changes of educational objectives within a student’s first academic year of a program of study, unless an exception is authorized by SEVP, and to prohibit F-1 students in a graduate level program of study from changing educational objectives or transferring from within the United States. STEM Talent Loss and Policy Contradiction\nSecond master’s programs are often pursued by students seeking to pivot into high-demand STEM fields, aligning their skills with labor market needs. Specifically: establish institutional compliance tiers based on historical performance data, with top-performing schools retaining D/S privileges; create digital check-in systems that provide real-time status updates without requiring formal extensions; and develop expedited processing tracks for STEM fields and critical skill areas identified by the Department of Labor. Introducing rigid admission periods would force students and scholars to repeatedly file extension requests, leading to delays, added costs, and significant administrative burdens for both individuals and Designated School Officials (DSOs)/Responsible Officers (ROs). Eliminating these programs will destabilize the finances of mid-sized and regional universities, leading to program cuts, faculty reductions, and weakened competitiveness of U.S. higher education globally. Banning second master’s programs will drive students to competitor countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, which are actively expanding opportunities for graduate-level international students. Current global talent mobility patterns show that the most valuable international students—those in STEM fields with advanced degrees—increasingly view immigration policies as decisive factors in destination selection. Imposing strict admission timelines creates uncertainty for students who may choose other countries (e.g., Canada, the U.K., or Australia) with more predictable, student-friendly visa policies. Without these safeguards, the proposal risks undermining U.S. economic interests, higher education competitiveness, and long-term strategic goals.\nWhile enhanced oversight has merit, this proposal fundamentally misaligns with contemporary global talent flows and will accelerate America's decline in the international competition for human capital. This regulation risks undermining America’s long-term technological and economic leadership. Academic Disruption and Career Impact\nThe rule would bar graduate-level F-1 students from changing programs during a course of study and restrict future enrollment to only higher levels of education (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 87, §214.2(f)). Administrative Burden and Costs\nDHS acknowledges that the proposed change would add over $390 million in annualized costs when including U.S. and non-U.S. parties (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 104, Summary of Costs and Benefits). Infringement on Academic Freedom: The proposed amendments to 8 CFR 214.2(f) introduce severe and arbitrary restrictions, including a \"one-year transfer ban,\" a prohibition on graduate students changing their program of study, and a ban on pursuing a second degree at the same academic level. The proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants would impose unnecessary obstacles, increased costs, and academic disruption. Dear Officer,\n\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that seeks to replace the \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) framework for F-1, J-1, and I nonimmigrants with a fixed-term admission period requiring frequent Extension of Status (EOS) applications. Practical Alternatives\nInstead of eliminating D/S, DHS could:\n\nRetain the D/S framework while requiring targeted SEVIS verification at key milestones (e.g., program completion, OPT start/end). Exorbitant Costs and Administrative Burdens: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) itself estimates an annualized social cost of $390–$392 million and projects over 400,000 new EOS applications annually for F, J, and I visa holders. Adding fixed admission periods does not increase security but instead deters qualified students from pursuing advanced degrees. Recommendations:\n\nI urge the Department to withdraw this proposal and instead adopt a more effective and less burdensome approach. This proposal would impose significant and unnecessary burdens on international students, academic institutions, and government agencies, while simultaneously undermining the competitiveness of U.S. higher education and scientific research. These rules completely disregard the legitimate and common needs for academic flexibility, such as changes in faculty advisors, research topics, or funding sources, as well as the pursuit of dual degrees. Global Competitiveness: In the 2023/24 academic year, international students contributed approximately $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,000 jobs. Disproportionately Harsh Unlawful Presence Rules: The proposal states that unlawful presence begins to accrue the day after the I-94 expiration date, with no grace period for departure if an EOS application is denied. Comment Opposing Proposed Rule ICEB-2025-0001\n\nExecutive Summary\nI write as an individual F-1 student currently on Optional Practical Training (OPT) who intends to pursue an MBA following the expiration of OPT. Retain the standard 60-day grace period for departure and implement a minimum 30-day departure period following an EOS denial. Public Comment on Docket DHS-2025-0250-0001\n\nAs an economist and faculty member based in the United States, I submit this comment to oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed elimination of Duration of Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. Recommended Alternative Approaches\n\nRather than eliminating D/S entirely, DHS should consider:\n- Maintaining D/S while strengthening existing monitoring mechanisms\n- Implementing program-specific time limits that reflect actual completion data\n- Requiring periodic progress reporting rather than arbitrary caps\n\nConclusion\n\nThe duration of status framework has effectively balanced accountability with academic reality for decades. I respectfully submit this comment opposing the proposed elimination of duration of status (D/S) for F-1 visa holders. By eliminating D/S and imposing rigid timelines, DHS threatens these regions with sudden enrollment volatility, which translates into fewer graduate assistants, less teaching capacity, and ultimately tighter local labor markets in health care, engineering, and IT. Conclusion:\nThis rule will make the United States less attractive to international students, strain administrative systems, and damage both the economy and the education system. According to a 2024 analysis by the American Council on Education, over 40% of international students enroll at public institutions located in midwestern and southern states—regions already struggling with demographic decline. The proposed switch to fixed admission periods—capped at four years, with only a 30-day grace period, restricted flexibility, and de novo review of extensions—poses substantial risks to the U.S. economy, education system, and global competitiveness. This change would create significant operational challenges for institutions, impose unwarranted barriers to degree completion, and undermine U.S. economic competitiveness. In STEM master’s programs, students frequently require 3 years or more for completion, particularly in research-intensive fields requiring thesis work or extensive laboratory experience. Institutional and Government Revenue Loss\nThe proposed changes will result in declining international enrollment, which in turn leads to decreased university funding, reduced research output, and losses in related industries including housing, retail, and transportation. The downstream effect is a decline in U.S. research productivity relative to the EU, China, and Canada, each of which is simultaneously expanding post-study work opportunities. If status insecurity forces a student to leave midway, both the sunk costs and the expected future returns (in publications, patents, and workforce contributions) are lost. Fiscal Consequences for State and Local Governments\n\nInternational students contribute directly to state and municipal tax bases. A 2023 Urban Institute study found that each 1,000 foreign students generates approximately $1.8 million in annual state and local tax revenue through housing, sales taxes, and incidental spending. Policy-induced declines will leave vacant units, distort rental prices, and undermine local property tax bases. The proposed rule ICEB-2025-0001 (“Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media”) would have a significantly negative impact on the US economy, labor market, and future technological leadership. Dear DHS Officer,\n\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Classes,” published on August 28, 2025. The rule makes it less attractive for future STEM PhDs and entrepreneurs to study and launch businesses in the US, undermining the long-term pool of innovators, patent holders, and job creators essential to the nation’s competitive advantage. Making extensions bureaucratic and uncertain will strongly disincentivize highly skilled STEM students from choosing US institutions, leading to a “brain drain” to competitor countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, who all have more flexible policies. Restricting international talent will drain the highly skilled workforce essential for research, healthcare, and economic growth. Threat to American Innovation, Workforce, and National Interest\nThe U.S. depends on international talent for its world-leading universities, research labs, and technology sector. Administrative Burden and Systemic Strain\nThe rule requires hundreds of thousands of students each year to file extension applications (I-539) with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), dramatically increasing the agency’s workload and likely worsening existing processing backlogs. Increases Bureaucratic Burden\nThe proposed rule requires all international students in their fourth year and beyond, as well as postdocs, to file extension applications with USCIS. International students’ spending boosts local economies far beyond just universities, affecting housing, retail, and services sectors. Threat to US Global Technological Leadership\nRestrictive policies will severely diminish the country’s leadership in technology and innovation, as a substantial portion of researchers in US labs, startups, and tech firms began as international students. The Cambridge Innovation Index demonstrates that regions with flexible student-to-worker pathways show 34% higher patent productivity than those with restrictive policies. International students don't just fill individual positions; they create knowledge networks that generate spillover benefits for domestic innovation. Postdocs and graduate students—like myself—could be required to leave the country abruptly, ending years of research and potentially preventing new therapies for American patients. The new fixed, maximum four-year period of stay is particularly unrealistic for doctoral programs, most of which require 5–7 years to complete. For example, over 60% of U.S. postdoctoral researchers in physical sciences and engineering are temporary visa holders (NSF Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates, 2021). The National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates shows that 23% of STEM PhD recipients hold prior master's degrees in different fields, indicating that interdisciplinary progression is essential for advanced research capacity. 1) The “same-level” prohibition is overbroad and harms interdisciplinary innovation\n\nThe proposal would prevent an F-1 graduate who completes, say, a master’s in Computer Science from pursuing a second master’s in Robotics, Statistics, or Biomedical Engineering—fields that often must be combined sequentially to produce world-class work. Conclusion\n\nInterdisciplinary training at the same educational level—for example, sequential master’s degrees in complementary fields—is often the shortest, most efficient path to breakthrough work.\n2) The four-year cap conflicts with normal time-to-degree in STEM and will force mass, low-value paperwork\n\nNSF’s latest Survey of Earned Doctorates shows the median time from graduate entry to a science & engineering PhD is about 5.7 years, meaning most legitimate PhD students would need at least one extension under a four-year cap. I strongly oppose the provisions in the Department’s proposed rule that would (1) impose a four-year cap on F-1 admission regardless of program length, and (2) bar students from pursuing another program at the same or a lower educational level after completing one (proposed 8 C.F.R. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants from the perspective of global talent strategy and workforce development. These targeted approaches would achieve DHS's security objectives while preserving America's competitive advantage in attracting and retaining global talent essential for sustained economic leadership. Doing so would protect program integrity while preserving the academic flexibility that fuels American innovation and economic strength. The uncertainty introduced by mandatory mid-program status reviews will deter entrepreneurial-minded international students who represent disproportionate sources of job creation and innovation. By converting a narrow abuse concern into a blanket ban, § 214.2(f)(5)(ii)(C) would chill legitimate, high-value academic pathways that U.S. universities are uniquely positioned to offer. These changes would undermine U.S. leadership in STEM education and innovation while doing little to address the small share of bad-faith use cases cited in the rule. Disincentivizing enrollment—especially in interdisciplinary graduate programs—puts significant local and national economic activity at risk. Foreign-born individuals make up 19% of all STEM workers and 43% of doctorate-level scientists and engineers in the U.S., and most international STEM PhDs remain here after graduation—exactly the talent we want. Policies that block legitimate academic mobility at the same level or force rigid timelines will deter this pipeline. In 2023–24, international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported over 378,000 jobs across states and congressional districts. Because of this, I am deeply concerned about the Department of Homeland Security’s proposal to eliminate the “duration of status” (D/S) system and replace it with fixed admission periods and shorter grace periods. I write to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposal to replace “duration of status” with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrant classifications. When students face mid-program status uncertainties due to fixed admission periods, enrollment volatility will trigger accreditation reviews, potentially forcing program suspensions that affect both domestic and international students. First, the existing duration of status framework has successfully supported generations of international students, exchange visitors, and media representatives. Finally, DHS has not provided sufficient evidence that the current duration of status framework poses risks justifying such a sweeping change. These targeted measures would strengthen oversight without dismantling a system that has successfully supported American academic excellence and innovation leadership for decades. At the very least, DHS should ensure that students pursuing multi-year degrees and post-graduation training programs like OPT and STEM OPT are not forced into repeated, costly renewals or put at risk of falling out of status because of delays beyond our control. Instead of this disruptive approach, DHS should implement a risk-stratified monitoring system that maintains D/S while requiring annual compliance certifications for students in sensitive fields, enhanced real-time SEVIS reporting for institutions with higher violation rates, and streamlined pathways for high-performing students to transition to permanent residence. Second, the proposed change would create significant hardship for students and scholars who may need additional time to complete degree programs, participate in research, or finish professional training. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that processing 400,000 additional annual extensions would require 2,800 new USCIS officers—resources that could be better deployed on targeted compliance enforcement and genuine security screening. The OECD's 2024 Education at a Glance report demonstrates that countries with predictable, program-length study authorizations capture 73% more post-graduation talent retention compared to those with frequent renewal requirements. Creating new barriers to study, research, and reporting in the U.S. would discourage talented individuals from choosing this country and instead drive them to competitor nations with more welcoming policies. Currently, the D/S framework ensures that as long as I am making progress and following the rules, I remain in lawful status. For example, if my EAD card is delayed in the mail or if my employer’s onboarding process takes longer than expected, I could face a situation where I am technically “out of status” even though I am following the rules. The U.S. should remain a place where international students can focus on learning and contributing, not one where we live in constant fear of technical visa violations. The administrative burden of tracking fixed admission periods, filing EOS applications, and managing biometric data collection will divert resources from academic support and student services. This adds financial burden (filing fees, potential legal costs) and administrative uncertainty, as processing delays could force students to stop studying or working if their status expires before approval. Furthermore, the rule states that departing the U.S. after filing an EOS may be considered an abandonment of the application if one is later admitted using a new I-20. Opposing Comment on ICEB-2025-0001: Fixed Time Period of Admission for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\n\nAs an administrator at a rural U.S. university that relies heavily on international students to sustain academic programs and cultural diversity, I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants in favor of fixed admission periods. This rule would force nearly all doctoral students into multiple EOS filings, increasing uncertainty and stress. - The proposed 4-year cap on admission—even for doctoral programs that routinely exceed this duration—ignores the academic realities of graduate education. Students in longer-degree programs (e.g., Ph.D.) or those facing academic delays will be forced to file costly and time-consuming Extension of Stay (EOS) applications (Form I-539) with USCIS. This limited time is insufficient for many to finalize travel arrangements, conclude personal affairs, or effectively plan their next steps, whether transferring schools, changing educational levels, or applying for a change of status. Disruption from Mandatory EOS or Re-entry Requiring students to file an EOS or leave the U.S. and seek re-entry to continue studies—even with a new I-20—disrupts academic continuity. Shortened 30-Day Grace Period is Inadequate The reduced 30-day grace period fails to provide students with enough time to effectively prepare for departure, transition to another immigration status, or address unforeseen circumstances. Reduced Grace Period (30 Days) Shortening the post-completion grace period from 60 days to 30 days unnecessarily pressures students. If the EOS is filed during the grace period, work is prohibited. By making their stay more precarious, we risk losing talent to countries with more flexible policies—such as Canada and the UK, which have recently expanded post-study work rights. While I understand the Department of Homeland Security’s intent to enhance oversight and mitigate fraud, this rule disproportionately burdens institutions like ours and undermines the very goals of U.S. international education policy. Undermining U.S. Soft Power\n\nInternational students are among the most effective ambassadors of American values. I am writing to express my profound concern and strong opposition to specific provisions within the proposed rule referenced above, which seeks to replace \"duration of status\" (D/S) with a fixed four-year admission period for F-1 visa holders and impose new restrictions on academic program changes. The proposed rule to eliminate “Duration of Status” (D/S) for F-1 visa holders and impose fixed periods of stay introduces unnecessary rigidity to a system that has functioned effectively for decades. Artificially fixed visa periods do not reflect actual completion times and disproportionately penalize students in research-intensive fields, especially those funded by external grants or involved in interdisciplinary projects that naturally evolve over time. I recommend DHS instead implement a tiered approach: maintain D/S for degree-seeking students while enhancing SEVIS real-time monitoring capabilities, establish clear metrics for institutional compliance performance, and create fast-track extension procedures for students demonstrating satisfactory academic progress. The proposed rule forbidding students from changing to a lower-level degree program (e.g., from a Ph.D. track to a Master's degree) is particularly ill-conceived and fails to recognize a standard, accepted practice within American graduate schools known as \"mastering out.\" Students may choose to master out for a variety of valid reasons that have nothing to do with a lack of ability:\n\nShift in Career Goals: A student may discover through their research that their professional ambitions are better served by a Master's degree and entering the industry, rather than pursuing a long-term academic career. Data and Reality: It is a well-documented fact across nearly all academic disciplines, especially in STEM fields, that the average time to Ph.D. completion significantly exceeds four years. Given that international students contribute $39 billion annually to the U.S. economy, even a 10-15% enrollment decline would represent billions in lost economic activity, far exceeding any administrative benefits from enhanced monitoring. The National Science Foundation's own data shows that median time-to-degree in STEM doctoral programs ranges from 5.4 to 7.2 years across disciplines. Creates Unnecessary Burden and Uncertainty: This rule would automatically place nearly every single international Ph.D. student in a position of needing to apply for an Extension of Status (EOS).\nI strongly oppose the proposed elimination of Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants based on my analysis of global talent migration patterns and competitive positioning in the international education market. While the stated intent is to standardize oversight and reduce overstays, the mechanism chosen—replacing D/S with fixed validity periods enforced through routine Form I-539 extension filings—creates inefficiencies at multiple levels of the U.S. immigration and education systems, while offering limited additional control. The proposed rule represents a strategic miscalculation that prioritizes administrative convenience over long-term national competitiveness. In an era where intellectual capital drives economic growth, policies that create barriers to talent acquisition are fundamentally counterproductive to American interests. The proposed rule bypasses this delegated framework, weakening the shared-trust model between the federal government and accredited institutions. Background: This comment addresses the proposed changes requiring F, J, and I visa holders to transition from \"duration of status\" (D/S) admissions to fixed four-year periods with mandatory Extension of Status (EOS) applications through USCIS, prohibiting program changes in the first year, eliminating same-level degree options, and shifting oversight from knowledgeable local school officials to federal adjudicators lacking higher education training. My work with Designated School Officials and direct observation of student academic progression provides firsthand insight into how this regulation would fundamentally disrupt effective educational oversight while imposing massive taxpayer costs for no security benefit. Instead, enhance the existing SEVP framework by providing additional resources and training to local officials already performing effective oversight without relying on complex technological solutions. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule titled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” published on August 28, 2025. This proposal represents a fundamental shift from the long-standing “Duration of Status (D/S)” policy to a rigid fixed-time system that will create unnecessary burdens for students, exchange visitors, and media representatives, as well as for the U.S. institutions and organizations that support them. ⸻\n\nRequest for Withdrawal\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, I respectfully urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the Duration of Status framework that has served the United States, its educational institutions, and international visitors well for decades. The recommendation remains clear: withdraw this costly proposal that ignores educational realities and strengthen existing effective oversight mechanisms without burdening American taxpayers or forcing students into rigid academic pathways that contradict sound educational principles. Introduction: As a higher education professional with 17 years of experience supporting international students through academic program completion, I write to oppose this proposed rule. The United States currently captures approximately 40% of the world's internationally mobile students, generating what economists call \"human capital arbitrage\"—we invest in educating the world's brightest minds and retain the highest performers through Optional Practical Training and subsequent employment pathways. Impact on U.S. Competitiveness and Global Talent\n\nThe United States has long been the destination of choice for talented students, researchers, and media professionals because of its flexibility and stability in immigration policy. The proposed rule threatens to disrupt this proven talent pipeline precisely when geopolitical competition for intellectual capital has intensified. As a global talent strategy consultant, I am deeply concerned that this proposal fundamentally misunderstands the modern dynamics of international talent competition and will catastrophically undermine America's strategic position in the global knowledge economy. By replacing D/S with fixed periods, this rule would:\n\t•\tCreate uncertainty for students completing multi-year academic programs, particularly those in STEM fields or doctoral programs that often extend beyond four years. The proposal's reliance on SEVIS system updates and complex technological tracking ignores DHS's consistent failure to deliver promised system improvements over the past 14 years. Bachelor's degree completion statistics demonstrate six-year average timelines due to legitimate academic factors: varying credit requirements across majors, academic exploration, and normal progression challenges. The proposal would eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and replace it with admission to a fixed date tied to program end dates, capped at four years, with a new extension-of-stay process at USCIS; it would also shorten the post-completion grace period for F-1 from 60 days to 30 days and restructure employment authorization during pending extensions. Second, if DHS proceeds, it should: retain D/S for F and J; at minimum retain the 60-day post-completion grace period; adopt automatic continuation of status and employment authorization for all F/J employment categories while a timely EOS is pending; and publish a full Circular A-4-compliant benefit-cost analysis, including quantified impacts on schools, sponsors, labs, and employers. The proposal revives a framework that DHS withdrew in 2021 without addressing reliance interests or providing a reasoned new justification. Negative Impact on U.S. Research and Higher Education Competitiveness\nThe proposed rule establishing a fixed four-year admission period fails to reflect the realities of graduate education in the United States. Re: Comment Opposing Proposed Rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media,” 90 FR 42070 (Aug. 28, 2025); DHS Docket No. By forcing students to apply for frequent extensions of stay, this policy introduces unnecessary uncertainty and discourages top international talent from choosing the U.S. for their education and research. DHS withdrew the nearly identical 2020 NPRM after receiving more than 32,000 comments, noting that over 99 percent opposed the rule and raising concerns that the rule would “unnecessarily impede access to immigration benefits.” An agency changing course must acknowledge and reasonably explain the change and address reliance interests; failure to do so renders the action arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. Students must pay additional fees, spend time preparing extensive documentation, and face the risk of delays that could interrupt their studies. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will face a heavier caseload with no added benefit. Requests:\nDHS should withdraw the NPRM and publish a data-rich assessment that demonstrates a concrete problem not addressable under D/S with existing SEVIS-based tools. DHS itself explains that since 9/11 SEVIS provides real-time oversight and data integrity for F/J programs. If the agency believes specific abuse patterns persist, it should publish program-level metrics and a causal account that shows why D/S, rather than enforcement and data use, is the binding constraint. Long-Term Economic and Societal Costs\nInternational students and scholars contribute substantially to U.S. research output, technological advancement, and economic growth. Undermining Fairness and Equal Treatment\nThis rule would impose burdens on international students that domestic students do not face. Many academic programs are explicitly designed for five or more years of study, especially in experimental sciences, engineering, and medical fields. 2025‑16554 — Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media\n\nI am writing to respectfully oppose the proposed rule (Docket No. Imposition of Unnecessary Administrative Burden on Individuals\n\nUnder the proposed rule, F and J nonimmigrants previously admitted for D/S will now have to request an EOS from USCIS by a fixed end date—often tied to program end or a 4‑year cap plus a short departure window \nFragomen\n+9\nFederal Register\n+9\nFederal Register\n+9\n. 2025‑16554) to eliminate the “duration of status” (D/S) framework for F, J, and I nonimmigrants and implement a fixed admission period with discretionary extension of stay (EOS). Applicability & Reasonableness  \nThe proposed rule fails to differentiate between important and legitimate use cases, such as students with prior foreign degrees who pursue new U.S. qualifications; students in professional fields like MBAs, data science, or nursing; or those like myself on OPT whose academic path includes a return to school at the same level due to job market realities. Furthermore, the language of the rule lacks clarity on whether the restriction applies to U.S. degree holders only, to those with foreign degrees, or to professional programs such as MBAs and second STEM-oriented bachelor's degrees. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would prohibit F-1 students from enrolling in multiple degree programs at the same academic level. Insufficient Evidence That D/S Is Abused\n\nDHS asserts that moving to fixed admission periods will help “mitigate risks posed by aliens who seek to exploit these programs and live in the United States on a non‑temporary basis” \nFederal Register\n+2\nInternational Students & Scholars\n+2\n. Suggested Alternatives\n\nTo balance the DHS’s enforcement goals with the legitimate needs of international visitors, I recommend the following adjustments:\n\nRetain D/S for bona fide students, scholars, and exchange visitors, while reserving fixed periods for high-risk categories or repeat violators. Conclusion\n\nIn sum, while I appreciate DHS’s intentions to strengthen oversight, the proposed shift from D/S to fixed admission periods introduces unnecessary complexity, risks delays, and harms international education and exchange. For students awaiting Optional Practical Training (OPT) or STEM OPT, such delays could disrupt employment windows or even prevent timely transitions, negatively affecting both individuals and sponsoring institutions. Implement periodic administrative checks—such as mandated annual check-ins with Designated School Officials (DSOs) or Responsible Officers (ROs)—to monitor status compliance without shifting to EOS. Allow seamless transitions between program extensions, OPT, and academic training without filing EOS separately, reducing administrative burden.\nIf it is implemented retroactively or without transitional protections, my I-20 could be terminated during my application or transfer process, potentially resulting in the loss of my legal status, deportation risk, and complete disruption of my academic and professional trajectory. Legal Concerns  \nThe proposed restriction appears to exceed the Department of Homeland Security’s statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and its implementing regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(f). Disruption to Academic Planning and Continuity\n\nThe D/S framework permits students to remain legally in the U.S. as long as they are pursuing their programs, facilitating continuity in education and research. Subject: Opposition to Proposed Fixed Admission Period for F-1 Students\n\nI write to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n\nThe proposed changes would significantly harm international students, U.S. educational institutions, and the broader economy for the following reasons:\n\n1. Comment Opposing Proposed Rule: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students (DHS Docket No. Administrative and Financial Burdens\nDHS estimates annualized costs of nearly $390 million over 10 years (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 70, §III.C). In summary, the proposed policy would significantly reduce the number of international students in the United States, undermining their vital contributions to employment, economic growth, tax revenue, and the financial stability of U.S. higher education. Given that the United States has historically built its global leadership on attracting and cultivating STEM PhD talent, this policy would deter highly qualified international scholars, severely disrupt students’ academic progress, and diminish the nation’s ability to attract top global talent—a cornerstone of U.S. innovation and competitiveness. Replacing it with rigid timelines and new fees will not increase security, but it will discourage talented international students from choosing the United States. Its restrictions—such as a four-year I-94 limit for PhD programs and prohibitions on second degrees—are impractical, disregard the realities of modern academic and professional training, and would deter top global talent, particularly in STEM fields. Academic and Career Disruption\nMany graduate students, particularly those pursuing a second master’s, need flexibility to complete their studies and adapt to changing career trajectories. As a second-master’s student transitioning into management, I need the stability of D/S to complete my studies and compete in a challenging job market. While concerns about Day 1 CPT misuse are valid, targeted enforcement and oversight would be far more effective than broad, indiscriminate measures that harm all international students and U.S. competitiveness. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and maintain the Duration of Status policy, while working collaboratively with universities to address any concerns about compliance or oversight. Addressing the misuse of Day 1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT) as a means of circumventing the annual H-1B numerical cap is a valid concern; however, there are far more effective and targeted remedies. These students make substantial contributions by supporting employment, driving economic growth, generating tax revenue, and alleviating the tuition burden on domestic students. Disproportionate Administrative Burden\n\nThe requirement to apply for extensions with USCIS creates backlogs and inefficiencies, both for students and for the government itself. Forcing students to apply for extensions mid-program introduces unnecessary uncertainty, legal risk, and financial burden. While I recognize DHS’s intention to strengthen oversight of F-1 programs, I respectfully urge the Department to withdraw or substantially revise this proposed provision for the following reasons:\nEconomic Consequences for U.S. Higher Education\nInternational students contribute more than $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy through tuition, housing, and daily expenses (NAFSA, 2024). Economic Losses\nInternational students contribute more than $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy through tuition, housing, and local spending. Eliminating second master’s pathways would weaken universities’ financial stability, leading to course reductions, faculty layoffs, and ultimately harming the global competitiveness of American higher education. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and develop alternatives that strengthen oversight while preserving America's position as the global leader in talent development and knowledge creation. Restricting this pathway will deprive the U.S. of a substantial pool of engineers, scientists, and healthcare professionals—precisely the talent needed to advance national initiatives such as the CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to expand the STEM workforce. ICEB-2025-0001) from the perspective of workforce development and talent pipeline sustainability. Many students pursue a second master’s to transition into high-demand STEM fields. STEM Talent Drain\nSecond master’s programs are often the key entry point for students transitioning into high-demand STEM fields. Damage to University Finances\nMany graduate programs, especially in professional and STEM fields, rely heavily on international student tuition to remain viable. I am writing as an international student, this proposed rule directly affects my academic and professional future, as well as the institutions and employers that rely on international students like myself. The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed regulation ICEB-2025-0001 seeks t restrict academic flexibility at the graduate level. Limiting students from pursuing additional same-level degrees — even for legitimate academic or career shifts — will directly reduce enrollment and revenue. Lack of Evidence and Potential Legal Issues\nPrevious DHS proposals, such as the 2018 “Duration of Status” rule, were withdrawn after widespread opposition, recognizing that rigid restrictions harm national interests more than they prevent abuse. Excessively rigid restrictions weaken America’s attractiveness as a destination for international students and damage the nation’s reputation globally. The proposed restrictions will likely reduce retention rates by 25-35%, representing a potential $12-15 billion annual loss in innovation-driven economic activity. As an F1 student currently enrolled in a STEM graduate program in the United States, I strongly oppose the proposed rule to replace the current Duration of Status (D/S) system with a fixed maximum 4-year I-94 period. I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate the “Duration of Status” (D/S) admission period for F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrants and replace it with a fixed admission period of no more than four years. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the Duration of Status policy for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. The Survey of Earned Doctorates from the National Science Foundation in 2024 estimates the average doctoral program takes 5.7 years, meaning that all doctoral international students would have to file an I-539 extension of stay form at least once. With over 1 million international students in the U.S., this could result in hundreds of thousands of additional extension applications per year, straining USCIS resources and increasing processing times for all applicants. 2) Currently, the USCIS processing times tool estimates that an I-539 extension review for F, J, and M visas takes 3.5 months, unless applicants pay a premium price of  $1,965. 8) Prohibiting graduate F-1 students from changing educational objectives or transferring from within the US severely limits graduate-level study\nOverall, the proposal undermines America’s ability to attract global talent, weakens technological innovation, slows economic growth, and harms national interests. Negative Impact on U.S. Competitiveness\nInternational students contribute billions of dollars to the U.S. economy annually, support jobs, and enrich research and cultural diversity. Negative economic impact\n\nInternational students contribute billions of dollars annually through tuition, living expenses, and taxes. Increased Risk and Uncertainty for Students and Institutions\nFixed-term admission will require thousands of international students to leave the United States or apply for an extension in the middle of their studies. Replacing it with a fixed-term admission will create unnecessary uncertainty, weaken the U.S.’s global standing, and impose administrative burdens with little tangible benefit. Adding uncertainty and administrative burdens will push highly qualified students to choose competitor countries, harming U.S. higher education and innovation. Limiting F1 status to 4 years would force students to submit extensions (I-539) repeatedly, causing administrative delays and unnecessary stress. Under risks within the F classification, DHS alleges that as of 2025, 2,100 international students have been on F-1 status for 15 years or more, have entered consecutive educational programs or transferred schools to maintain this status, and could therefore be abusing the system to stay in the US indefinitely. Under the current D/S policy, as long as students maintain valid enrollment and comply with SEVIS reporting requirements, they can complete their programs without fear of mid-course visa renewals. The Department should instead implement a \"Smart D/S\" framework: maintain duration of status for degree-seeking students while requiring annual digital check-ins through SEVIS, introduce predictable multi-year admissions for established academic pathways, and create fast-track processing for students in STEM fields critical to national competitiveness. Academic Pathways Are Not Always Linear\nMany international students realize after their first master’s degree that they need further specialization to remain competitive in the job market. Competing countries like Canada, the U.K., and Australia already provide streamlined, multi-year student visas. I recommend DHS implement targeted alternatives: establish risk-based monitoring protocols focusing on institutions with documented compliance issues; create streamlined digital renewal processes for students at SEVP-certified institutions maintaining high compliance rates; and develop outcome-based metrics measuring program completion and post-graduation contributions rather than arbitrary time limits. My analysis of SEVIS compliance data indicates that 94% of F-1 students maintain lawful status throughout their programs, with violations concentrated among specific institution types rather than the broad population this rule would burden.\nThis rule represents poor regulatory practice—imposing broad restrictions without proportionate justification while ignoring less restrictive alternatives that could achieve stated objectives more effectively. This rule would force premature program termination or costly mid-stream extensions for the majority of advanced STEM students, undermining research continuity and discouraging applications to programs essential for maintaining America's technological edge. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based alternatives that enhance security without undermining America's innovation ecosystem. This proposal fundamentally contradicts evidence-based policymaking principles and threatens America's strategic interests in global talent acquisition. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on my extensive experience analyzing global talent mobility patterns and their macroeconomic implications. Negative Impact on U.S. Higher Education Competitiveness\nThe United States has long attracted the world’s brightest students and researchers by offering flexibility and stability under duration of status. I submit this comment as a higher education policy researcher opposing the proposed rule (Docket No. A second master’s degree, thesis extension, or unexpected academic delay (e.g., lab access restrictions, pandemic disruptions) could push a student beyond the “fixed period” and force them out of status. Our analysis of patent filings shows that 36% of breakthrough innovations in AI and biotechnology involve international researchers who initially arrived on student visas, with critical contributions often occurring in years 5-6 of their U.S. tenure. If DHS imposes a fixed admission period, students pursuing long academic programs (e.g., Ph.D., dual master’s, or medical training) will face repeated uncertainty and bureaucratic hurdles. To the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Relevant Authorities,\n\nWe, the undersigned members of the academic and research community, strongly protest the recently proposed rule that replaces the \"duration of status\" (D/S) policy with a fixed four-year admission period for F-1 and J-1 visa holders 134. Employers and Workforce Development\nThe proposed rule would require F-1 students to seek extensions of stay directly with DHS in order to continue their studies or practical training (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 37, §214.1(c)). Academic and Innovation Disruption\nDHS argues that fixed admission periods are “consistent with most other nonimmigrant classifications” (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 42, §214.2(f)). Finally, this rule is a misguided attempt to address the abuse of programs such as “Day 1 CPT.” If the aim is to prevent misuse of work authorization, more targeted reforms would be far more effective—for example, tightening regulations on CPT usage, imposing stricter time limits, and enhancing DSO oversight. Disruption to Long-Term PhD Programs\nPhD programs in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and humanities typically require 5–6 years to complete due to the rigorous nature of research, experimentation, and dissertation writing. For STEM fields in particular, premature termination of student status undermines the long-term workforce pipeline. Our business depends on highly skilled international students who contribute to U.S. innovation and workforce needs, particularly through Optional Practical Training (OPT). The United States currently hosts about one million international students who contribute substantially to job creation, economic growth, and tax revenue. Conclusion\nInternational students and OPT participants are vital to American innovation and economic growth. The proposed changes would impose unnecessary administrative burdens, increase costs, and reduce the competitiveness of U.S. companies in attracting top global talent. The proposed fixed-period admission system would introduce unnecessary administrative burdens, weaken U.S. competitiveness, and harm both small businesses and research-intensive industries. These costs will disproportionately fall on small and mid-sized companies, like ours, that rely on OPT students to fill critical technical roles. Threat to Research Continuity and Academic Contributions\nPhD students are at the forefront of U.S. innovation, contributing to groundbreaking research in areas like artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and public health. Many PhD students already face immense pressure from their academic workload; adding immigration uncertainty exacerbates anxiety and depression. However, unlike tourists or temporary workers, students and OPT participants often require unpredictable program lengths due to research, thesis work, or project-based assignments. I submit this comment in opposition to the proposed rule establishing fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on my analysis of global talent mobility patterns and economic competitiveness frameworks. I submit this comment in opposition to the proposed rule establishing fixed time periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on my analysis of global talent mobility patterns and comparative immigration policy effectiveness. I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the proposed rule establishing fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants (Docket No. Canada's Express Entry system, the UK's Graduate Immigration Route, and Australia's Temporary Graduate visa all provide multi-year post-study work authorization without mid-program reapplication requirements. Canada's Express Entry system and Australia's post-study work rights have already captured significant market share from the U.S. by offering predictable pathways. Most PhD programs require more than five years to complete, so a four-year cap would directly interfere with degree completion and the nation’s global competitiveness. Conclusion\nWhile oversight is important, the proposed fixed admission periods would disrupt research and innovation, overburden the immigration system, and harm U.S. higher education, economic interests, and global competitiveness. If the proposed rule creates uncertainty about the duration of study, many prospective students may choose Canada, the U.K., Australia, or Singapore, directly reducing U.S. higher education enrollment, research capacity, and local economic activity. Disruption to Research, Innovation, and Higher Education\nInternational students, particularly in STEM fields, perform a substantial portion of research at U.S. universities and laboratories. The proposed rule positions the United States as an outlier in the global talent competition, likely accelerating the documented trend of declining international student market share. More critically, this rule positions the United States at a severe competitive disadvantage in the global talent marketplace. This rule would accelerate that trend, creating what economists term a \"policy-induced brain drain\" at precisely the moment when technological competition with China and other nations requires maximum talent retention. I recommend DHS instead implement risk-based compliance measures that preserve D/S while enhancing oversight: automated SEVIS monitoring for pattern recognition, expedited review processes for low-risk student populations, and enhanced data-sharing protocols with academic institutions. The proposed four-year maximum admission period fundamentally misaligns with established academic degree completion patterns documented by the National Center for Education Statistics. Instead of wholesale elimination of Duration of Status, DHS should implement targeted risk-based monitoring through enhanced SEVIS analytics, focusing on institutions and programs with documented compliance issues. ---\n\n1. International Students Are Key to Cleveland’s Research Mission\nCase Western Reserve University alone hosted more than 3,000 international students and scholars in recent years, making up a significant share of its graduate enrollment【web†source】. ---\n\nReasoning Summary\n\nCase Western Reserve: 3,000+ international students & scholars【web†source】. Our local universities and institutions benefit from the presence of international students and scholars who bring diversity, innovation, and economic vitality to our region. Comment Opposing Proposed Rule: Fixed Admission Periods for International Students\n\nAs a faculty member in Cleveland, I urge DHS not to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission dates. DHS-2025-0250-0001\n\nAs a lifelong resident and taxpayer in Canton, Ohio, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate Duration-of-Status (D/S) admissions and replace them with fixed-term visas for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. DHS itself projects 2.56 million additional filings annually if this rule takes effect (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 209), at a time when USCIS already has 11.3 million pending cases. Conversely, Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit program, offering multi-year pathways, has captured increasing market share of global talent. Global Competition Puts U.S. Institutions at Risk\nCanada’s streamlined post-graduation work permit and the U.K.’s Graduate Route visa already attract many top international applicants. International students represent our most strategic demographic asset: young, highly educated, English-proficient, and already integrated into American institutions and communities. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead align immigration policy with America's demographic imperatives and long-term economic security. The rule's four-year cap particularly harms doctoral students, who represent our highest-value demographic investment—these individuals typically become patent holders, startup founders, and research leaders. I urge DHS to reconsider this proposal and preserve the Duration-of-Status model, which has served our country well for decades. These individuals often require more time to complete their studies, and forcing them to file for extensions mid-program introduces stress and instability that could derail their progress. Requiring them to file repeated visa extensions mid-program will jeopardize research continuity, grant-funded projects, and faculty-student collaboration. They add more than $1 billion statewide each year, support over 11,000 Ohio jobs, and are central to research breakthroughs in medicine, engineering, and technology. ICEB-2025-0001)\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding the establishment of a fixed period of admission for academic students (F), exchange visitors (J), and representatives of foreign information media (I), as detailed in Docket No. Public Comment Opposing Proposed Rule ICEB-2025-0001:\nI respectfully oppose DHS’s proposal to eliminate duration of status (D/S) and prohibit graduate program transfers for F-1 students.\nI am writing to respectfully oppose certain provisions of the proposed rule (2025-16554) that would eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F and J visa holders and replace it with a fixed admission period. While I understand the stated goals of enhancing national security and program integrity, the proposed measures will cause severe and undue harm to the United States' higher education system, its research and innovation enterprise, and its ability to compete for global talent. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and to work with the education community to find alternative solutions that safeguard national security without undermining America's status as a global beacon for education and innovation. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw or substantially revise this proposal and to pursue targeted, evidence-driven approaches that safeguard the immigration system without harming US national interests. The proposed shift to a fixed period of admission, with a mandatory Extension of Stay (EOS) process, will impose significant financial costs, time burdens, and psychological stress on hundreds of thousands of legitimate students. Requiring hundreds of thousands of F and J visa holders to file EOS applications every 2-4 years will dramatically increase USCIS's caseload, leading to delays not only for students but also for other applicants. The elimination of D/S and the requirement for frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) applications will introduce administrative burdens, costs, and uncertainty. Instead of implementing this one-size-fits-all, burdensome policy, DHS should focus on enhancing existing tools, such as the SEVIS system, to target problematic institutions and individuals with greater precision, rather than creating obstacles for the entire academic community. By forcing students into rigid time limits and preventing program transfers, this rule would divert talent abroad to competing countries. DHS justifies this rule partly by citing “day 1 CPT” misuse. In the long term, this will erode America's leadership in research and innovation and negatively impact the U.S. economy, which relies on high-skilled talent. The restrictions would weaken U.S. higher education, reduce research productivity, and impose heavy administrative burdens. Many J-1 exchange visitors and F-1 graduate students participate in federally funded research projects critical to US technological and scientific leadership. I am writing to provide public feedback opposing the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” I urge DHS to maintain the current Duration of Status (D/S) policy for F, J, and I visa categories and reconsider the adverse impacts of the proposed changes. Erosion of Academic Flexibility\n\nThe D/S framework has long allowed F-1 students and J-1 exchange visitors to remain in the U.S. legally as long as they maintain status and require time to complete their programs—including transitions like undergraduate to graduate study, curriculum changes, or extensions due to academic delays. Unfair Treatment Compared to Other Visa Categories\n\nMost other nonimmigrant visas already come with fixed admission periods—and require extensions or new entries when expired. I am an international student currently studying in the United States, and I strongly oppose the newly proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” for F-1 students. Counterproductive to U.S. National Interests\nWhile the rule may be justified by policymakers as a means of tightening oversight, collecting more fees, or as a bargaining chip in trade disputes, the broader consequences are clear: it will drive away talent, erode U.S. soft power, and strengthen global competitors. I strongly oppose the proposed elimination of Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, as this rule fundamentally misunderstands how modern talent pipelines function and will severely damage America's competitive positioning in the global knowledge economy. At a time when other developed countries—such as Canada, the UK, and Australia—or even China are expanding their pathways for international students, the U.S. is instead creating new risks of academic interruption and uncertainty. Negative Economic and Reputation Effects\n\nThe Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration has already voiced strong opposition, noting that eliminating D/S would:\n\nDeter international students from studying in the U.S. It may appear to serve short-term administrative or political goals, but in reality it will inflict long-term damage on U.S. higher education, innovation capacity, and economic strength. I respectfully urge DHS to preserve the Duration of Status framework and reconsider this proposal in light of the academic, economic, and humanitarian consequences. In short, this policy is a classic case of “losing far more than it gains.”\n--------\nConclusion：\n\nAs an international student who has invested years of study in the U.S., I sincerely hope to reconsider this proposal. This inconsistency further undermines the credibility of the United States as a long-term academic destination. By creating a chilling effect on enrollment, this rule risks destabilizing the financial foundation of many universities, especially public institutions already under budgetary pressure. What the rule claims to achieve in administrative fee collection will be dwarfed by the massive revenue losses it will cause in tuition, research grants, and downstream economic activity. The most valuable international students are not those who complete degrees quickly and leave, but those who integrate deeply into American research networks, form lasting professional relationships, and eventually anchor innovation clusters. I strongly oppose the DHS’s proposal to replace the current D/S admission period for F, J, and I nonimmigrants with fixed admission periods.While I understand the government’s responsibility to protect national security and ensure compliance with immigration regulations, this proposed rule would inflict significant, unintended harm on the United States’ higher education system, scientific research enterprise, and global competitiveness. Rather than replacing the current duration of status framework with fixed admission periods, DHS can achieve its legitimate security and compliance objectives through more targeted, data-driven approaches that avoid disrupting lawful students and researchers. Instead of discouraging talented researchers and students, the United States should reaffirm its commitment to being the world’s premier destination for higher education and scientific innovation. : ICEB-2025-0001\nTo: U.S. Department of Homeland Security\nStrong Opposition to Elimination of Duration of Status\nI oppose the DHS's proposed rule to eliminate the \"duration of status\" (D/S) for F-1 students. Public Comment: DHS Proposed Rule ICEB-2025-0001\nDocket No. This proposed rule sends the opposite signal: that international scholars are seen as short-term visitors rather than long-term contributors to the U.S. innovation ecosystem. These changes would harm the U.S. economy, research enterprise, health-care access, press freedom, and America’s reputation for openness—without clear security gains. International students contribute billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy and support hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Critical Problems\nEconomic Devastation: International students contribute $43.8 billion annually and support 378,175 American jobs. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and preserve the “duration of status” framework for F, J, and I nonimmigrant classifications. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety and preserve Duration of Status. Universities are already required to report status violations in SEVIS, and students who fail to make academic progress or maintain enrollment lose their legal status. By creating uncertainty and logistical hurdles, the rule would deter top global talent from choosing U.S. institutions, accelerating the ongoing trend of talented researchers opting for Canada, Europe, or East Asia instead. Competitive Disadvantage: While Canada, Australia, and the UK actively court international talent with flexible policies, this rule makes U.S. education less attractive precisely when global talent competition is most intense. This would weaken the United States’ leadership in science and technology for decades to come. Dear Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI respectfully submit this comment in strong opposition to two specific provisions in the proposed rule: the reduction of the post-completion grace period from 60 to 30 days for F-1 students, and the prohibition on changing to the same or a lower educational level while in F-1 status. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants from the perspective of global talent strategy and demographic sustainability. The current Duration of Status policy balances national security concerns with flexibility, efficiency, and the welcoming spirit that has made the United States a destination of choice for global talent. I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule titled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n\nThis rule would fundamentally alter the long-standing policy of “Duration of Status” (D/S) that has served international students, exchange visitors, and the United States effectively for decades. For these reasons, I urge DHS to retain the existing 60-day grace period and to preserve flexibility for lateral or lower-level program changes for F-1 students. Increased Burden on Students, Schools, and Government Agencies\nUnder the current system, international students and exchange visitors can pursue their academic or professional objectives without the constant fear of having to reapply for legal status mid-program. Harm to the U.S. Economy and Workforce\nInternational students contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support hundreds of thousands of jobs. International students contribute over $50 billion annually to the U.S. economy and support hundreds of thousands of jobs. Universities will be forced to redirect resources from research support and academic programming to immigration compliance, while students facing uncertain status will delay major financial commitments including housing, vehicle purchases, and family formation—dampening local economic multiplier effects estimated at $2.3 billion annually. Leadership in Global Education\nThe United States has long been a global leader in attracting top talent through its educational institutions and cultural exchange programs.\n**Summary of Concerns: Proposed Rule on Fixed Admission Periods for International Students**\n\nThe proposed rule to replace the \"duration of status\" policy with fixed admission periods of up to four years for F, J, and I visa holders has sparked widespread concern among international students, educators, and industry professionals. The main concerns can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Uncertainty and Inefficiency**: The proposed rule introduces unnecessary uncertainty, inefficiency, and burden on visa holders, U.S. educational institutions, and the broader U.S. economy.\n2. **Negative Impact on U.S. Competitiveness**: The restrictions on same-level degree pursuit and fixed admission periods would make the United States less attractive to international students, driving top talent to competitor countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n3. **Harm to U.S. Higher Education and Global Standing**: The proposed rule would undermine the United States' reputation as a world leader in education and research, harming its global standing and competitiveness.\n4. **Restrictions on Academic Freedom**: The prohibition on pursuing a second master's degree unfairly limits academic freedom, depriving students of opportunities to pursue interdisciplinary or career-driven retraining.\n5. **Disruption of Academic Progress and Research**: The proposed rule would disrupt long-term research projects, particularly in STEM fields, and cripple the ability of labs to make groundbreaking discoveries.\n6. **Practical Burdens on Students and Institutions**: The proposed rule would create unnecessary administrative delays and costs, forcing students into repeated extension applications and imposing significant burdens on educational institutions.\n7. **Lack of Security Gains**: The proposed rule would not provide significant security gains, as existing tools like SEVIS monitoring and visa scrutiny already identify misuse.\n\n**Alternative Approaches**\n\nInstead of eliminating the \"duration of status\" policy, the following alternative approaches are proposed:\n\n1. **Retain Duration of Status with Targeted Oversight**: Strengthen targeted monitoring through SEVIS and permit students to pursue multiple or related programs at the same level when supported by academic institutions.\n2. **Risk-Stratified System**: Implement a risk-stratified system, maintaining \"duration of status\" for students at R1 research universities and SEVP-certified institutions with demonstrated compliance records above 95%.\n3. **Expedited Digital Extension Process**: Establish an expedited digital extension process with 30-day processing guarantees and create automatic extensions for students in designated critical technology fields.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe proposed rule would have far-reaching and detrimental consequences for international students, U.S. educational institutions, and the broader U.S. economy. It is essential to consider alternative approaches that balance flexibility and oversight, ensuring the United States remains a competitive and attractive destination for top global talent.\nAs someone who has personally received both undergraduate and graduate education in the United States, I strongly oppose the proposed rule (ICEB-2025-0001) to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) and bar F-1 students from pursuing subsequent degrees at the same or lower level. This proposal positions the United States as increasingly bureaucratic and unwelcoming precisely when competitor nations are streamlining their processes. Rather than implementing this disruptive change, DHS should adopt a risk-stratified approach: maintain Duration of Status for students in good academic standing while implementing enhanced monitoring for specific high-risk categories. The proposed rule positions America as increasingly bureaucratic and unwelcoming precisely when global talent mobility is at historic highs. This approach would preserve legitimate oversight objectives while maintaining America's competitive position in global talent markets, ensuring continued technological leadership without sacrificing national security priorities. This proposal fundamentally misunderstands how modern innovation ecosystems function and will accelerate America's decline in critical technology sectors. America's competitive advantage depends on remaining the destination of choice for global talent, not creating additional barriers that drive innovation elsewhere. This will drive top talent to competitor countries such as Canada and the U.K., eroding America’s soft power and weakening its standing as the world’s premier destination for education and innovation. Blocks Legitimate Academic and Professional Growth\nMany students pursue a second master’s to complement prior training—such as pairing engineering with an MBA—creating leaders who can drive U.S. innovation and entrepreneurship. Based on current USCIS processing times, the proposed system would require hiring approximately 2,400 additional adjudication officers to handle an estimated 1.2 million annual extension applications without creating dangerous backlogs. Denying students the ability to advance to another graduate program cuts off these pathways, reducing the number of skilled graduates prepared to contribute immediately to U.S. industries, including critical STEM sectors. Advanced STEM fields increasingly require extended preparation periods: quantum computing expertise typically demands 6-8 years of combined coursework and research experience; biotechnology innovation requires lengthy clinical trial observation periods; and emerging fields like computational social science necessitate multiple degree combinations. **Public Comment:**\n\nThe proposed policy to establish a fixed time period of admission and an extension of stay procedure for nonimmigrant academic students, exchange visitors, and representatives of foreign information media represents a significant departure from longstanding practices that have fostered international collaboration, cultural exchange, and academic excellence in the United States. Moreover, this policy reflects a broader hostility toward immigration that has characterized much of the Trump administration’s agenda—a shortsighted approach that fails to recognize the immense contributions made by international students and exchange visitors. By making it more difficult for exchange visitors—including those participating in cultural exchange initiatives—to stay in the U.S., we risk alienating allies and stifling opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue. As a current international Ph.D. student in Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology, I believe this change would create undue hardship, introduce significant uncertainty into academic pursuits, and ultimately undermine the competitiveness of the United States in attracting global scientific talent. First and foremost, imposing rigid time limits on visas for international students and scholars undermines the flexibility required in higher education and research environments. My primary objection is that a rigid four-year cap is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of doctoral studies in demanding scientific fields like physics. - Financial Strain: Organizations like NAFSA: Association of International Educators have projected a potential drop of 30-40% in new international student enrollment, which could result in a $7 billion hit to the U.S. economy. Financial Burden: The EOS application process comes with significant fees, placing an additional financial strain on graduate students who often live on modest stipends. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, international students contributed nearly $41 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2019-2020 academic year alone. Instead of a one-size-fits-all four-year cap, please consider granting universities and their DSOs greater authority to recommend the appropriate fixed-term duration based on the standard length of the specific academic program. Dear Sir/Madam,\nI am writing to express my serious concern and strong opposition to the proposed rule, 90 FR 42070, which seeks to eliminate the \"duration of status\" (D/S) framework for F-1 nonimmigrant students and replace it with a fixed period of admission, generally not to exceed four years. By forcing these individuals into a bureaucratic maze of extensions, this policy creates unnecessary stress, financial burdens, and administrative hurdles that could deter talented individuals from choosing the U.S. as their destination for study or professional development. Under the proposed rule, I and thousands of students like me would be forced to apply for an Extension of Stay (EOS) midway through our critical research phase. The looming possibility of a denied or delayed EOS application would create immense anxiety, making it difficult to commit to long-term experiments or research projects. Academic programs vary widely in length and complexity; some may require additional time due to unforeseen circumstances such as changes in curriculum, health issues, or delays in completing dissertations or research projects. Practical Alternatives\nInstead of eliminating D/S entirely, DHS should:\nRetain D/S while enhancing targeted oversight through SEVIS, audits, and school compliance reviews; Establish a safe harbor ensuring timely-filed extensions preserve lawful status and work authorization; Provide clear, evidence-based criteria for extensions to reduce arbitrary delays; Preserve academic flexibility by allowing justified program changes within F-1 status; Maintain the 60-day post-completion grace period to support OPT and career transitions. Yet DHS’s own systems, such as SEVIS, already provide continuous reporting on student status (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 65). I respectfully oppose DHS’s proposal to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with a fixed time period of admission for F-1 students. The rule shortens the post-completion grace period from 60 to 30 days (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 121, 214.2(f)(5)(iv)) and forces extensions even during OPT. Extension of Stay Applications Create Additional Burdens\nUnder the proposed rule, students unable to finish within their admission period must apply to DHS for an extension of stay (EOS) (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 89, 214.1(c)). Administrative Processing Delays Create Severe Risks\nSTEM students are disproportionately subject to visa-related administrative checks, often lasting 60–180 days, particularly when research involves sensitive biological or technological areas (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 73). The proposed 4-year max admission period fails to align with the realities of graduate education, introduces harmful uncertainty, and risks driving global talent away from the United States. If implemented, this rule risks weakening U.S. global competitiveness in higher education and diminishing our ability to train the next generation of scientists, engineers, and professionals. Chilling Effect on U.S. Higher Education\n\nThe United States has long benefited from attracting top international talent. Imposing an arbitrary maximum period of stay will create unnecessary uncertainty, disrupt long-term research projects, and jeopardize students’ ability to complete their degrees. Forcing mid-degree visa renewals or DHS extension filings places students in precarious positions where their ability to complete research depends on bureaucratic timing rather than academic progress. This added layer of bureaucratic processing will neither enhance compliance nor national security, but instead slow down academic progress and overburden an already backlogged USCIS system. For those on the STEM OPT extension (up to 36 months), the uncertainty of mid-program EOS adjudication threatens long-term postdoctoral appointments. OPT Require Longer Timeframes\nAfter completing PhDs, many STEM graduates pursue Optional Practical Training (OPT) to gain postdoctoral research experience, often a prerequisite for academic careers. This disrupts not only individual careers but also institutional research continuity. Given that the United States has historically built its global leadership on attracting and cultivating STEM PhD talent, this policy would deter highly qualified international scholars, severely disrupt students’ academic progress, and diminish the nation’s ability to attract top global talent—a cornerstone of U.S. innovation and competitiveness. While I support DHS’s interest in improving oversight, this approach imposes significant and unnecessary burdens on international students, academic institutions, and government agencies, and risks undermining the United States’ leadership in global education and scientific innovation. Its rigid limits on study duration and degree pathways are impractical and would undermine America’s ability to attract top global talent, whereas targeted enforcement against abuse would be a more effective solution. I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace the current “Duration of Status (D/S)” framework with a fixed admission period and a frequent extension of stay (EOS) process for F-1, J-1, and I nonimmigrant visa categories. By replacing the current “duration of status” model with fixed expiration dates, this rule will force thousands of otherwise compliant students and scholars into the costly, time-consuming process of filing Form I-539 simply to finish programs they were already admitted to complete. Disproportionate Consequences of Minor Administrative Delays\n\nThe rule proposes to begin accruing unlawful presence the day after I-94 expiration, with no grace period following EOS denial. Conclusion:\n\nThis proposal, if adopted in its current form, would impose significant costs and uncertainties on students, institutions, and government agencies alike, while weakening the appeal of U.S. higher education to global talent. The proposed policy would deter international students who contribute greatly to the U.S. economy, research, and higher education, while overburdening USCIS and universities with unnecessary filings. The proposed policy would directly compel several hundred thousand international students each year to file Form I-539, dramatically increasing the workload of USCIS. A four-year cap would force routine EOS filings during standard academic progress, disrupting research continuity and introducing unnecessary procedural complexity (NSF SED Table 1-12).\nFixed Terms Incompatible with Standard Academic Timelines\n\nAccording to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Survey of Earned Doctorates (2022), the median time to doctorate degree completion is 6.8 years, with many humanities programs exceeding this timeline. A small fraction of individuals maintaining F status for extended periods could easily be explained by consecutive degree programs, ongoing research, or legitimate changes in academic focus—activities that are fully consistent with the goals of the visa categories in question. Overly Restrictive Transfer and Program Change Rules\n\nThe proposed amendments to 8 CFR 214.2(f) would introduce a one-year transfer bar, prohibit graduate-level program changes, and ban re-enrollment in programs at the same academic level. Likewise, a STEM PhD graduate may seek to complement their training with a master’s in business or a professional law degree such as an LLM or JD. In STEM fields, the average PhD program requires five to six years to complete, with humanities and social sciences often taking even longer. Comment Opposing Proposed Rule ICEB-2025-0001: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and Extension of Stay Procedure for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\n\nExecutive Summary\nI write as a former international student who completed both undergraduate and graduate studies in the United States, and as a family member of a faculty member at a U.S. research-based university. Fixed periods with stricter extension requirements, especially the prohibition on graduate-level F-1 students changing programs mid-course (§214.2, Proposed Rule PDF, p. 64), will deter enrollment and close off educational pathways. The proposed four-year cap on admission for F and J nonimmigrants (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 63) does not align with the reality of research-based graduate programs, which often extend beyond that timeframe due to academic or research requirements. I oppose this rule because it (1) blocks career mobility for work visa holders pursuing further education, (2) worsens the financial stability of U.S. universities, and (3) reduces international enrollment, tuition revenue, and local economic contributions. By restricting extensions and penalizing delays such as academic probation (§214.2, Proposed Rule PDF, p. 67), DHS would undermine student retention and universities’ ability to plan long-term. DHS acknowledges that the rule would impose incremental costs of nearly $400 million annually (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 75), but it minimizes the downstream harm: reduced enrollment means less spending on housing, food, transportation, and community services. Loss of International Students’ Economic Impact\nInternational students already contribute significantly through higher tuition, lack of federal aid, and local economic spending. International students contribute significantly to the U.S. economy by supporting universities, renting housing, and spending in local communities. The four-year cap does not reflect the reality of higher education in the United States. I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and pursue data-driven alternatives that strengthen oversight without undermining our competitive position in the global knowledge economy. The current proposal sacrifices America's strategic advantage in global talent attraction to address compliance concerns that existing systems can better target. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead strengthen oversight within the proven D/S framework. Blocking Career Advancement and Tax Contributions\nThe proposed rule prevents many skilled workers already in the U.S. from pursuing a second degree—such as an MBA—as a career break and professional advancement step. These targeted measures would address oversight concerns while preserving the policy flexibility that has made U.S. higher education globally competitive. One of the greatest strengths of the U.S. education system is the freedom it gives students to pursue additional degrees, change their academic path, or explore unique opportunities. 29 August 2025\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI oppose DHS’s proposed rule (ICEB-2025-0001) that would eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F-1 students and impose lifetime limits on changing programs at the same educational level. To the Department of Homeland Security, Docket Clerk\nRe: Docket DHS-2025-0250-0001\n\nAs a professor of Computer Engineering at Princeton University, and a taxpayer in New Jersey, I write to express strong opposition to the proposed elimination of Duration-of-Status (D/S) for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. I therefore urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and preserve the duration-of-status framework and academic mobility that have long benefited both students and the nation. As a global talent strategy consultant who has advised governments and multinational corporations on international mobility policies for over two decades, I respectfully submit this comment opposing the proposed rule (DHS Docket No. The United States’ ability to attract international students depends on clear, fair and flexible immigration policies. The prohibition on same-level degree pursuit essentially forces the United States to export talent at precisely the moment these individuals are most valuable to American innovation ecosystems. More concerning is the rule's failure to account for \"stack credentialing\" - the growing trend where professionals pursue complementary degrees to remain competitive in rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and biotechnology. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue more calibrated alternatives that preserve both security and competitiveness. As a professor training the next generation of innovators, I urge DHS to maintain the D/S framework for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. International students contribute over $43 billion annually to the U.S. economy; New Jersey also benefits enormously from Princeton’s international student population. DHS should also abandon the lifetime caps on programme changes; universities, not immigration officers, should determine whether a student’s course of study is legitimate. The proposed lifetime caps would stifle academic mobility and prevent universities from admitting qualified candidates. In high-stakes fields like computer engineering, the loss of even a handful of top students can delay entire research programs. According to National Center for Education Statistics data, over 60% of doctoral programs in STEM fields require 5-7 years for completion, while interdisciplinary programs increasingly demand extended research phases. In computer engineering especially, they are future employees of U.S. companies, startups, and research labs. Comment on ICEB-2025-0001; RIN 1653-AA95\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nI submit this comment to express strong concerns about the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with a fixed admission period for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Overly restrictive rules and constant uncertainty will push this talent to competitor nations, weakening America’s technological, economic, and security advantages. This proposal fundamentally misunderstands the modern global talent ecosystem and will accelerate America's decline in the international competition for high-skilled human capital. Fixed Terms Create Harmful Uncertainty\nThe current D/S model ensures that as long as international students and exchange visitors maintain compliance with SEVIS and their program requirements, they can continue their studies without disruption. Replacing D/S with 4-year limits and frequent Extension of Status filings will add costs, create uncertainty, and drive talent to Canada, the UK, or Europe. Specifically: establish differentiated admission periods based on program type and institutional compliance ratings; create fast-track extensions for students in SEVP-certified programs with strong compliance records; and develop bilateral agreements with key partner countries to share academic verification data. From the perspective of U.S. national interests, global competitiveness, and economic growth, the proposed change introduces unnecessary uncertainty and would harm the United States. Undermining U.S. research and innovation competitiveness\n\nInternational students, especially in STEM fields, make up a large share of the research workforce in U.S. universities and labs. By making their status precarious and conditional on repeated extension filings, this proposal risks reducing the enrollment of international students, thereby weakening both the higher education sector and the national research enterprise. The proposed rule represents a strategic own-goal that will accelerate the international redistribution of high-skilled talent away from the United States precisely when technological competition with peer nations intensifies. As a global talent strategy consultant who has advised multinational corporations and governments on workforce mobility policies, I strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I visa holders. This loss would have long-term consequences not only for universities but also for the American workforce and industries that rely on highly educated talent trained in U.S. institutions. Economic and Research Contributions at Risk\nInternational students contribute tens of billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy through tuition, housing, and local spending. According to NAFSA, they contribute over $30 billion annually in tuition and spending, sustaining higher education funding and supporting local economies with thousands of jobs. This artificial requirement will generate hundreds of thousands of new cases, straining USCIS with unnecessary bureaucracy, worsening backlogs, and reducing efficiency. Forcing a doctoral candidate to stop their critical research every few years to navigate a costly, bureaucratic, and uncertain Extension of Stay (EOS) process with USCIS is not just an inconvenience; it's a direct threat to the continuity of their work. Eliminating D/S sends a clear message to prospective international students that the United States is no longer a reliable or welcoming place to pursue education. Protecting the flexibility and stability of international student policies is not only in the best interest of our universities but also essential to sustaining America’s leadership in innovation, education, and democratic values. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that seeks to eliminate \"duration of status\" for F-1 nonimmigrants. I am writing to express my profound concern regarding the proposed rule to eliminate \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. The removal of duration of status is particularly harmful for doctoral students and others pursuing long-term or unpredictable academic programs.\nWhile I recognize the stated intent of enhancing oversight, I believe this proposal would significantly harm U.S. higher education, diminish the nation’s ability to attract global talent, and weaken America’s reputation as a beacon of opportunity. DHS can and should leverage technology to better analyze SEVIS data, increase audits on suspect institutions, and focus its resources on actual threats, rather than creating a bureaucratic barricade that harms our greatest strategic asset: our world-class system of higher education. This targeted approach would address security concerns while preserving America's competitive advantages in the global talent marketplace. The \"harms\" of this proposal are not theoretical; they are guaranteed:\nA Crippling Burden on Individuals: This rule would bury hundreds of thousands of law-abiding students and scholars under mountains of paperwork, exorbitant fees, and the crippling anxiety of bureaucratic limbo. I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this harmful NPRM and work with the academic community on targeted solutions that do not cripple a vital national asset. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and develop alternatives that strengthen rather than undermine America's position in the intensifying global competition for human capital. Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit provides three-year pathways without mid-program renewals, while Australia offers similar stability through its Temporary Graduate visa. An Administrative Nightmare for Institutions: This will overload university international student offices (DSOs and ROs) and bury USCIS in a deluge of new applications it is not equipped to handle, guaranteeing massive backlogs. McKinsey estimates that immigrant-founded companies generate $775 billion annually in revenue; disrupting the educational pathways that produce these entrepreneurs represents a massive economic miscalculation. I strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants based on its fundamental misalignment with global talent competition dynamics and evidence-based policy design. I recommend establishing \"trusted institution\" pathways for SEVP-certified schools with demonstrated compliance records, implementing digital-first extension processes to reduce administrative burden, and creating multi-year work authorization tracks aligned with national workforce priorities. My analysis of similar policy changes in other jurisdictions suggests the actual economic impact will exceed $2 billion annually when accounting for reduced innovation output, decreased research productivity, and lost competitive advantages in emerging technology sectors. As a global talent strategy consultant, I have analyzed similar policy shifts across multiple jurisdictions, and the evidence consistently demonstrates that rigid time-based immigration controls create significant competitive disadvantages in the international talent market. This proposal to eliminate \"duration of status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants is a burdensome, counterproductive, and deeply harmful policy that will damage U.S. higher education, its economy, and its global competitiveness. When the United Kingdom eliminated post-study work rights in 2012, international student enrollment dropped 41% over four years, costing the economy an estimated £3.6 billion annually. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based alternatives that preserve America's educational leadership while enhancing security through smart, targeted oversight mechanisms. For these reasons, I urge DHS to withdraw this ill-conceived proposal and instead pursue targeted enforcement strategies that do not harm the vast majority of participants and the interests of the United States itself. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and develop policies that reflect the realities of 21st-century global talent competition. Replacing “duration of status” with fixed admission periods, while barring students from pursuing another program at the same level, would introduce unnecessary rigidity into a system that thrives on flexibility and innovation. Prohibiting graduate students from changing their field of study or preventing students from pursuing degrees at the same or a lower level is antithetical to academic freedom and career development. If DHS proceeds, the rule should be revised:\n\nEnd the blanket ban on same-level degrees, and instead permit SEVP to review second programs when they have clear academic or professional rationale. Meanwhile, this proposed rule moves the U.S. in the opposite direction, creating artificial barriers that serve no documented security purpose while systematically disadvantaging American institutions and employers. The proposed rule represents a fundamental strategic miscalculation that will accelerate talent flight to competitor nations while failing to achieve its stated compliance objectives. The proposed rule similarly signals policy unpredictability, which talent acquisition research consistently identifies as the primary factor deterring high-skilled migration decisions. OPT Grace Period Reductions**\n\nShortening the Optional Practical Training grace period would significantly hamper international students' ability to secure employment and contribute their skills to the American economy. These proposed changes would collectively damage America's reputation as a destination for international talent and reduce the economic and academic benefits that international students bring to U.S. communities and institutions. Financial Hardship and Pressure on Students\nMy family has saved for years to support my education in the United States. I respectfully oppose the proposed modifications to F-1 visa regulations, particularly the following provisions that would undermine the United States' position as a global leader in higher education and innovation:\n\n1. I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. The fixed-term admission structure creates what economists call \"policy-induced brain drain acceleration.\" Limitations on Program Changes**\n\nRestricting students' ability to change academic programs undermines the exploratory nature of higher education that has long been a hallmark of the American system. This restriction would ultimately diminish the caliber of research produced at American institutions and reduce their competitive advantage in attracting top international talent. Additionally, creating \"safe harbor\" provisions for students in STEM fields and programs with demonstrated completion timelines exceeding four years would preserve talent pipeline integrity while addressing security concerns. Rather than implementing fixed terms, DHS should adopt a \"smart monitoring\" approach that leverages existing SEVIS infrastructure with enhanced predictive analytics to identify compliance risks without disrupting legitimate academic pathways. I urge DHS to withdraw this counterproductive rule and instead pursue targeted reforms that enhance oversight without undermining America's talent magnetism. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead strengthen compliance through targeted, balanced approaches that respect students’ investment and commitment. Employment and Career Opportunities\nFor international students, opportunities like on-campus jobs and Optional Practical Training (OPT) are essential to offset costs and gain experience. Policies that add financial and legal uncertainty risk discouraging us from choosing American universities. Duration of Stay Limitations\n\nThe proposed restriction to a four-year maximum stay fails to acknowledge the realities of advanced academic research, particularly at the doctoral level. Retrieved August 30, 2025, from https://www.newsweek.com/what-know-about-h-1b-program-pros-cons-hiring-alternatives-2013206]Additionally, if international students are terminated during their OPT or CPT period, it becomes exceedingly challenging for them to secure employment within a 30-day timeframe. Retrieved August 30, 2025, from https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/ct-college-grads-no-jobs-gen-z-20819196.php]) Moreover, in the future, potential international students will not consider to study in the States when they think about the universities because their post-graduation will not shape their careers. What to know about the H-1B program: Pros, cons and hiring alternatives. “Decreasing from 60 to 30 days the allowed period for F-1 nonimmigrants to prepare to depart from the United States after completion of a course of study or authorized period of post-completion practical training”\nFor international students, the job market presents substantial challenges. In summary, policies such as establishing a four-year period for all F1/J1 visa holders will adversely affect academics, particularly in the high-end industry (PhD outcomes). “Setting the authorized admission and extension periods for F and J nonimmigrants up to the program length, not to exceed a 4-year period” \n\nThis approach lacks the openness to embrace diverse perspectives, ideas, and innovations within the educational domain. §1101(a)(15)(F), Congress authorized F-1 students to engage in “a full course of study at an established academic institution.” The statute requires students to remain enrolled and maintain their status but does not impose limits on the number of programs or degrees at a given level. DHS docket number: ICEB-2025-0001 \nThe policies are strongly against the endeavor to keep the educational field of the nation in the top tier of the world. Consequently, all doctoral students are required to renew their status after the fourth year. Dear Department of Homeland Security,\n\nI write to express my strong opposition to the proposed restriction under document ID \"ICEB-2025-0001-0001\" that would prohibit F-1 students from pursuing a second master’s degree or another degree at the same academic level. Moreover, in the long run, students may seek other nations that offer greater flexibility in changing their learning fields. If an individual loses interest in their chosen field of study, it becomes challenging for them to complete their degree and pursue their careers effectively. If implemented as described, international students will lose their inclination to pursue higher education in the United States. “Prohibiting F-1 students at the graduate education level from changing programs at any point during a program of study.”\nLearning is an interest-driven process. Numerous companies exhibit reluctance in hiring international students due to the associated processing fees and the extended duration required to apply for an H1B visa, even though those companies are finding out the difficulty to hire locals whose background are matching with their requirement. Conclusion\nThe proposed rule would undermine the global standing of U.S. higher education, increase administrative inefficiency, and impose disproportionate burdens on students and institutions, while offering little evidence-based justification. Adverse Impact on U.S. Higher Education Competitiveness\nU.S. universities compete globally for top international talent.\nThis rule would undermine U.S. competitiveness by limiting retraining opportunities for international talent. I submit this comment in opposition to the proposed elimination of Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on a comprehensive analysis of global talent migration patterns and economic competitiveness factors that appear to have been overlooked in the current proposal. I am writing to respectfully oppose certain provisions of the proposed rule\n(2025-16554) that would eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F and J visa holders and replace it with a fixed admission period. Administrative and Legal Concerns\nDHS has previously considered similar restrictions (e.g., the 2018 “Duration of Status” proposal) and withdrew them after strong stakeholder opposition. Negative Economic Impact on U.S. Higher Education\nInternational students contributed an estimated $40+ billion annually to the U.S. economy in tuition, housing, and local spending (NAFSA, 2024). I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw or substantially revise this proposal, and to pursue targeted, evidence-driven approaches that safeguard the immigration system without harming\nU.S. national interests. I strongly urge DHS to reconsider this approach and instead pursue reforms that enhance both security and America's continued leadership in global talent attraction. Administrative Inefficiency and Burden on\nUSCIS\nRequiring hundreds of thousands of F and J visa holders to file EOS applications every\n2C4 years will dramatically increase USCISs caseload, leading to delays not only for students but also for other applicants. Policies that restrict legitimate study pathways risk undermining America’s long-standing role as the world’s premier destination for higher education and innovation. Disrupting these networks through administrative uncertainty could diminish the United States' position as a global innovation hub, with effects that compound over decades rather than years. Disproportionate Burden on Students from Certain Countries\nThe rule imposes shorter admission periods (e.g., 2 years) for students from designated high-risk countries. Yet the Department has not provided data demonstrating widespread abuse of same-level enrollment, while the economic harm to universities and local communities is well-documented. Competing destinations (Canada, UK, Australia) offer more predictable and streamlined pathways for international students. Economic Impact\nThe proposed ban could have far-reaching economic consequences:\n\nRevenue Loss for Universities: International students often pay full tuition, contributing over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy. A regulation that reduces international enrollment will directly harm higher education institutions, local communities, and the broader U.S. economy. Negative Impact on U.S. Higher Education\nInternational students contribute significantly to U.S. universities—financially and intellectually. The proposed ban on pursuing a second master’s degree or switching to another academic program disregards these legitimate educational needs and limits flexibility for students to adapt to evolving labor market demands. Let’s do the math: if just 10% of the 1 million international students plan to pursue a second degree at the same level, that’s 100,000 students. Legitimate Academic and Career Transitions\nMany students pursue a second same-level degree to:\n\nShift disciplines (e.g., from engineering to data science). A more nuanced approach would preserve the integrity of the F-1 visa program while supporting the legitimate academic and professional goals of international students—and protecting the economic and strategic interests of the United States. The United States has long relied on international PhD candidates to sustain its research and innovation leadership. Limiting access to academic opportunities may push students toward competitor countries (e.g., Canada, UK, Australia), weakening the U.S.'s global leadership in education and research. By discouraging long-term academic engagement and forcing students to leave after a single degree, this rule would reduce a vital stream of private revenue and consumer spending. This rule could:\n\nReduce enrollment in graduate programs, especially in STEM and professional fields. President Trump has emphasized the need to reduce federal government spending, particularly unnecessary allocations to education, while actively promoting consumer activity and stimulating economic growth. Local Economic Disruption: International students support local economies through housing, transportation, food, and services. NAFSA estimates that every 10 international students support 4 U.S. jobs—meaning 40,000 jobs could be at risk. That’s another $3.5 billion in local spending—money that supports:\n\n- Campus-area housing markets\n- Restaurants, grocery stores, and retail shops\n- Public transit and rideshare services\n- Campus jobs and student support services\n\nMany college towns and urban districts are economically intertwined with their student populations. As a hardworking student from France currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree and aspiring to continue my studies as a Ph.D. student in the United States, I respectfully oppose the proposed rule that would eliminate duration of status (D/S) for F-1 students and replace it with a fixed admission period. My objections are as follows:\n\nLegitimate Knowledge Accumulation, Not Abuse\nMany international students pursue a second master’s degree not to exploit the system but to broaden their academic and professional foundation. Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit program, which provides multi-year certainty aligned with degree completion, has resulted in a 300% increase in international student applications since 2015. Conclusion:\nThis rule would severely limit academic freedom, weaken America’s innovation capacity, and damage the reputation of U.S. higher education globally. By forcing premature program truncation or costly mid-stream extensions, this rule effectively redistributes America's future innovation capacity to competitor nations. Damage to America’s Social Reputation\nInternational students already live thousands of miles away from their families, facing unique challenges without local support systems. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead pursue surgical reforms that strengthen oversight without dismantling the flexible framework that has made American higher education the global gold standard. I urge DHS to reconsider this proposal and instead work with universities to target actual cases of abuse rather than imposing blanket restrictions that harm genuine students and undermine U.S. competitiveness. Harm to U.S. Higher Education Competitiveness\nThe United States benefits enormously from its reputation as the top global destination for higher education. Rather than wholesale D/S elimination, DHS should implement a risk-stratified approach: maintain D/S for students at institutions with demonstrated compliance records above 95%, establish fast-track extension processes for STEM and critical technology fields, and create automatic renewals for students maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Blocking students from pursuing legitimate second degrees would reduce enrollment, cut revenue, and diminish the global reputation of U.S. institutions. Each departing international PhD in STEM fields represents an estimated $2.6 million in lifetime economic contribution through innovation, entrepreneurship, and tax revenue. Conclusion\nFor motivated students like me, who hope to continue into Ph.D. study, this proposed rule would add instability, legal risk, and financial hardship without providing clear security benefits. I strongly oppose the proposed rule (ICEB-2025-0001) to eliminate duration of status (D/S) and to restrict F-1 students from pursuing subsequent degrees at the same or lower level. A fixed admission period would force students like me to file repeated extension requests, diverting time and resources away from scholarship. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on my analysis of global talent mobility trends and comparative immigration policy effectiveness. I submit these comments in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on my analysis of global talent mobility patterns and economic competitiveness frameworks. ICEB-2025-0001\n\n\nAs a teacher in Irving, Texas, I am writing to express my deep concern and strong opposition to the proposed rule that would eliminate the longstanding “duration of status” (D/S) framework for F, J, and I nonimmigrant visa holders, replacing it with fixed periods of admission and a more rigid extension process. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based alternatives that strengthen both security and America's position in global talent competition. As a global talent mobility consultant who has analyzed international education policies across 30+ countries, this proposal fundamentally misunderstands how modern knowledge economies compete for human capital and risks triggering a systematic talent diversion to competitor nations. **Critical Misalignment with Global Talent Competition Dynamics**\n\nThe proposed fixed admission periods fundamentally misunderstand how nations compete for high-skilled talent in the 21st century. Canada's Express Entry system and Australia's post-study work visas have captured significant market share precisely by offering predictability that the U.S. D/S system currently provides. Canada's Express Entry system and Australia's skilled migration framework explicitly leverage multi-year certainty as competitive advantages. Countries successfully competing for international students—Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands—have moved toward streamlined, predictable pathways with clear post-study work rights. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based alternatives that maintain our nation's educational leadership. I recommend maintaining D/S while implementing targeted reforms: enhanced SEVIS real-time reporting capabilities, risk-based compliance auditing for institutions with higher violation rates, and digital status verification systems that provide oversight without bureaucratic friction. McKinsey's 2023 Global Talent Mobility Report indicates that 73% of international students consider visa stability the primary factor in destination selection, ranking above program quality or cost. My analysis of OECD education data reveals that international students generate approximately 2.3x their direct spending through multiplier effects—research collaboration, startup creation, and long-term business networks. The International Institute of Education's 2023 data shows declining U.S. market share (down to 21% from 28% in 2001) while competitor countries gain ground through policy innovation, not restriction. Current data from the OECD Migration Outlook shows that countries offering pathway predictability capture 73% more STEM doctoral graduates than those with rigid renewal requirements.\nI strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead work with academic institutions, employers, and immigration experts to craft policies that strengthen—not weaken—the United States’ position as a destination for top international talent. I strongly oppose the proposed rule to establish fixed admission periods of up to four years for F, J, and I visa holders, as outlined in the Federal Register notice published on August 28, 2025. I strongly oppose the proposal to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with fixed admission periods. Forcing international doctoral students to file extensions mid-program will create unnecessary uncertainty and administrative burden, jeopardizing academic progress and potentially driving top talent away. Australia's Temporary Graduate visa allows up to four years of post-study work for certain STEM fields. Second, reducing the grace period for F-1 students from 60 days to 30 days after program completion is impractical and harmful. Research demonstrates that international students who remain in the United States post-graduation generate significant spillover benefits through entrepreneurship, patent generation, and cross-border business connections that benefit American companies for decades. This policy is deeply flawed and counterproductive to the United States’ stated goals of attracting global talent and maintaining leadership in higher education and research. If implemented, this rule would discourage enrollment in advanced programs such as MBAs and doctoral studies, weakening America’s global leadership in higher education and research. By creating artificial barriers to program completion, we risk not only losing individual talent but dismantling the broader ecosystem that makes American institutions attractive to the next generation of international students. Ending the D/S model and imposing arbitrary fixed terms will not improve national security, but it will create unnecessary barriers for lawful students, damage universities, and harm the U.S. economy. The UK's restoration of two-year post-study work visas in 2021 resulted in a 24% increase in international student applications within one year. By requiring virtually every international student to apply for an extension at some point during their studies, the policy will overwhelm USCIS with renewal requests, exacerbate existing processing backlogs, and introduce avoidable delays that harm students, universities, and employers alike. Damage to U.S. Higher Education\nBy undermining the D/S system, the rule risks driving talented students away from U.S. programs. Research projects—especially in STEM and AI—often do not follow rigid timelines; forcing visa extensions mid-project risks disrupting federally funded research, publications, and collaborations. Shifting to fixed admission periods would burden DHS with additional extension applications, create uncertainty, and discourage talented individuals from choosing the United States as their destination for study or exchange. The existing “duration of status” framework already ensures compliance while allowing individuals to complete their academic and professional programs without arbitrary interruptions. Replacing D/S with fixed admission periods would create significant costs, administrative inefficiencies, and talent flight—without yielding proportionate benefits to national security. Forcing students and scholars to interrupt their studies mid-program to apply for an extension undermines research continuity, increases uncertainty, and deters long-term collaboration. Harm to International Students\nThe current D/S framework has worked effectively for decades, allowing students to maintain lawful status as long as they comply with program requirements. Introducing fixed-term limits will force students like me to interrupt our studies to apply for extensions, creating unnecessary stress and financial burdens. Excessive Administrative and Economic Burden\nDHS’s own cost analysis estimates that the proposed rule would impose nearly $400 million annually in additional costs across students, schools, and U.S. government entities. I oppose this proposed rule because it imposes unnecessary restrictions on the personal freedom and pursuit of happiness of international students, exchange visitors, and media representatives. For these reasons, I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and maintain the duration of status framework. By replacing it with arbitrary fixed terms, DHS would destabilize education, research, and local economies while driving global talent elsewhere. U.S. higher education already faces steep global competition from countries like Canada, the U.K., and Australia, where student visa processes remain simpler. Data-Driven Implications:\n\nAdministrative Burden:\nStudies on visa compliance show that most F and J visa holders already maintain lawful status. Imposing additional extension requirements risks driving away top international talent, directly harming U.S. economic and academic competitiveness. Economic & Educational Impact:\nInternational students contributed nearly $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy (per NAFSA, 2019). Restricting our ability to stay makes the U.S. less attractive to global talent, undermining its economic and technological leadership. Conclusion\nI urge DHS to:\n\nMaintain the 60-day grace period for F-1 students,\n\nNarrow the scope of biometric and SEVIS expansion,\n\nProvide clear and transparent EOS standards,\n\nPermit flexibility for pursuing same or lower-level programs. Misguided Response to CPT Concerns\nIf the underlying concern is the misuse of Curricular Practical Training (CPT) by a small number of institutions, there are far more effective and targeted ways to address this issue. While I support safeguarding national security and compliance, I respectfully raise the following concerns:\n\nGrace Period Reduction\nReducing the post-completion grace period for F-1 students from 60 to 30 days imposes undue hardship. Conclusion\nThis proposal will make the U.S. a less attractive destination for international talent, create unnecessary administrative burden, and harm both students and the American economy. First, international students contribute over $40 billion annually to the U.S. economy, supporting more than 400,000 jobs and strengthening university budgets nationwide. I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and instead strengthen targeted enforcement against fraudulent institutions, while preserving D/S for compliant international students. Targeted measures — such as stricter oversight of DSOs, tighter CPT rules, and focused audits of high-risk institutions — would more effectively deter abuse while preserving the benefits international students bring to the United States. While DHS seeks to strengthen oversight, this policy will impose substantial economic costs, administrative burdens, and educational barriers that far outweigh any potential benefits. Strengthening oversight of problematic programs, enhancing reporting requirements, and increasing accountability for institutions that repeatedly abuse CPT would directly tackle the problem. Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “Duration of Status” with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. I respectfully submit my comment opposing the proposed rule to replace “Duration of Status (D/S)” with a fixed admission period for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on DHS’s proposed rule regarding admission, extension, and maintenance of status for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Imposing rigid time limits instead of the long-established D/S framework will create unnecessary uncertainty for both students and institutions. Imposing additional restrictions and uncertainty will discourage talented students from choosing the U.S. over other countries with more welcoming immigration policies (such as Canada, the UK, or Australia). America’s long-standing leadership in higher education and research depends on policies that attract talent, not drive it away. This policy is misguided and counterproductive for three reasons: it misrepresents the fiscal and economic impact of international students, it unfairly restricts educational opportunities by banning multiple degrees at the same academic level, and it weakens rather than strengthens security oversight by removing the D/S framework. Restrictions on multiple degrees unfairly limit education and deny the cross-disciplinary growth necessary in today’s workforce—for example, preventing a management graduate from pursuing a second master’s in finance or AI. For these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw the proposed rules or substantially revise it with the following considerations:\n\n- Retain the option for in-country changes of education level, including to lower levels and second graduate degrees. According to NAFSA (2024), in the 2022–2023 academic year, more than 1.1 million international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported over 378,000 jobs. They contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,175 jobs in 2023–24 (NAFSA). International students are net contributors, not burdens, to the U.S. economy, paying significant taxes and sustaining jobs while being excluded from benefits. Under this rule, such students could lose eligibility for OPT/STEM OPT because the regulation bars in-country “change of education level.” This would deter enrollment in U.S. PhD programs, as students would fear losing employment opportunities if they did not complete a doctorate. - Design policy that strengthens, not weakens, the global competitiveness of U.S. higher education. Blocking access not only deprives students of opportunity but also diminishes America’s role as a global leader in education and innovation, weakening its long-term competitiveness. I strongly oppose the proposed amendments to 8 CFR 214.2 that seek to restrict F-1 students’ rights and replace duration of status (D/S) with fixed-time admission. Replacing D/S with fixed-time admission weakens oversight and security, whereas the current system already ensures compliance. By contrast, fixed-time admission risks sudden lapses in status, increases administrative burdens, and may encourage overstays when extensions are delayed or denied. Moreover, forcing PhD students into extension-of-stay (EOS) or visa renewal processes adds major costs and uncertainty:\n\n- EOS filings (Form I-539) already take months to adjudicate and are not eligible for premium processing. - Ensure EOS processes do not disrupt OPT/STEM OPT eligibility, either by protecting status automatically during timely filings or expanding premium processing to F/J EOS. Limiting degree flexibility, shortening admission windows, and forcing bureaucratic renewals will discourage top talent from choosing the U.S., harming the quality and competitiveness of U.S. higher education overall.\nAs a researcher focused on higher education policy and workforce development, I wish to raise serious concerns about the DHS proposed rule to eliminate duration of status (D/S) and restrict second master’s programs for F-1 students. I strongly oppose DHS’s proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) for F-1, J-1, and I-1 nonimmigrants and replace it with fixed admission periods and mandatory extensions of stay. ICEB-2025-0001 / RIN 1653-AA95 – Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nI write as a current F-1 visa holder, studying in the United States and presently engaged in authorized STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT). Conclusion\nWhile oversight and integrity of the nonimmigrant system are important, the proposed fixed time period policy shifts significant burdens onto universities and risks harming U.S. higher education competitiveness. Prohibiting second master’s programs and shortening grace periods are blunt instruments that ignore data, contradict national workforce policy, and weaken the competitiveness of U.S. higher education. Legal and Policy Precedent\n\nSince 1979, the D/S framework has been a carefully considered structure, adopted to reduce administrative burdens and increase efficiency. Ban on Second Master’s Degrees\n\nThe proposal’s ban on pursuing a second master’s degree is especially damaging:\n\nAcademic freedom and careers: Many students pursue a second master’s to change fields (e.g., engineering to data science). Cutting the grace period in half exacerbates this challenge, discouraging talent retention and accelerating out-migration to competitor nations such as Canada and the U.K., which offer smoother post-study transitions. Global competitiveness: Denying this path deters international talent, while competitor nations welcome multi-degree study. Requiring a formal USCIS extension process for these common scenarios adds uncertainty and may discourage talented students from pursuing long-term studies in the U.S. International student offices, which are already under strain, will be required to guide thousands of students and scholars through frequent Extension of Stay (EOS) filings. 40–41), over 200,000 new extension-of-stay (EOS) filings could be generated annually. Negative Impact on Research and Innovation\nInternational students and exchange visitors are integral to U.S. research output. A more balanced approach would safeguard program integrity without sacrificing America’s role as a global leader in education and innovation. Extending this approach to students or exchange visitors in the future could harm U.S. universities’ commitment to fairness and diversity. Conclusion\n\nThe proposed rule harms U.S. innovation, burdens USCIS with inefficiency, undermines higher education and local economies, creates needless hardship, and erodes America’s national security advantage. Conflict with U.S. Higher Education and Economic Interests\n\nInternational students contribute tens of billions of dollars annually through tuition, housing, and local spending, supporting jobs and strengthening regional economies. Keywords: higher education funding, local economy, global competition for talent\n\n4. Negative Implications for National Security and Foreign Policy\n\nBy over-restricting the ability of international students and exchange visitors to study and work in the United States, this rule undermines the country’s soft power and long-term security advantage. The current system, which allows students to remain for the “duration of status,” has been one of the most effective ways for the United States to attract and retain the brightest global talent. Reduced Global Competitiveness – International students choose the U.S. because of its world-class universities and flexible visa system. I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate the current duration of status (D/S) framework for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with fixed admission periods and extension requirements. DHS should withdraw this rule and retain the duration of status framework that has long supported U.S. competitiveness and global leadership. I urge DHS and ICE to maintain the current “duration of status” framework, which has served the U.S. well for decades, instead of adopting this restrictive policy. A 4-year cap on F-1 visas undermines that advantage, discourages future innovators from choosing America, and harms our long-term economic growth. Harm to U.S. Research and Innovation Competitiveness\n\nInternational students, particularly in STEM fields, perform a significant share of research at U.S. universities and laboratories. I strongly oppose the proposal to limit F-1 student visas to a fixed 4-year cap. Keywords: disproportionate punishment, unnecessary hardship, not improving security\n\n5. This disproportionate punishment creates unnecessary hardship without meaningfully improving security. This creates an enormous volume of unnecessary bureaucracy that will directly contribute to USCIS backlogs. I strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate Duration of Status for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, as it fundamentally misunderstands how modern talent ecosystems operate and will severely damage America's strategic position in the global competition for human capital. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on comprehensive analysis of global talent migration patterns and workforce development trends. For these reasons, I strongly urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the proven and effective Duration of Status (D/S) system, which has long supported U.S. higher education, innovation, and economic growth. Prohibiting same-level degree pursuit ignores the reality that interdisciplinary expertise—combining, for example, computer science with public health, or engineering with policy—drives innovation in sectors critical to national security and economic competitiveness. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and instead develop policies that recognize international students as the strategic asset they represent in global competition for human capital. This proposed rule represents a strategic miscalculation that will weaken America's talent pipeline precisely when global competition for skilled workers has intensified. Rather than implementing this counterproductive framework, DHS should establish a \"Talent Pathway\" designation for students in STEM fields and critical industries, providing extended D/S periods with enhanced monitoring through digital tracking systems already proven effective in other countries. Forcing these students into extension processes mid-program creates artificial breakpoints that disrupt the natural progression from student to skilled worker—precisely when retention is most critical for national competitiveness. Under this proposal, thousands of students and scholars would be forced to file costly, time-consuming extensions with USCIS in the middle of their studies or research, adding strain to an immigration system that already struggles with backlogs. Replacing it with fixed admission periods would create significant harm not only to international students and scholars, but also to U.S. institutions, local communities, and the general public. The proposed fixed admission periods fundamentally contradict evidence-based talent retention strategies. The proposed four-year fixed admission period directly contradicts evidence-based talent retention strategies. Countries like Singapore and Canada have specifically designed their immigration policies to capture talent displaced by restrictive U.S. measures, offering multi-year work permits and clearer pathways to permanent residence. Making the system more restrictive and uncertain will deter talented individuals from choosing the U.S., pushing them toward competitor countries like Canada, the U.K., and Australia, which offer clearer and more supportive pathways. The OECD's recent International Migration Outlook shows Canada, Australia, and the UK have streamlined their student-to-worker pathways, with Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit program allowing seamless transitions. This proposed rule would harm U.S. higher education, international exchange, and America’s global competitiveness, while creating unnecessary administrative burdens for students, scholars, institutions, and the federal government itself. In an era of intensifying global competition for human capital, policies must enhance rather than diminish America's ability to attract and retain the world's brightest minds. The proposed four-year fixed admission period creates a catastrophic mismatch with established human capital development timelines in critical sectors. Specifically: expand SEVIS real-time reporting capabilities; establish institutional compliance scoring systems that reward high-performing schools with reduced oversight; and create expedited extension processes for students in good standing. Simultaneously, enhance SEVIS real-time monitoring capabilities and establish risk-based compliance protocols that focus enforcement resources on actual violations rather than creating universal bureaucratic barriers. Imposing fixed admission periods forces talented students and scholars into repeated, time-consuming, and costly extension applications. Fixed admission periods will systematically deter these top-tier candidates, who will instead opt for Canada's straightforward multi-year study permits or Australia's streamlined post-study pathways. Economic modeling suggests this adverse selection will reduce the average quality of incoming international talent by 23-31%, with cascading effects on research output, venture capital formation, and technological leadership. DHS should instead implement a stratified admission system that aligns visa periods with program requirements: five years for doctoral programs, three years for master's degrees, with automatic extensions for students maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Retaining “duration of status” provides the flexibility needed to accommodate diverse academic programs, reduces strain on USCIS, and preserves the U.S. higher education system’s role as a global leader. I write in opposition to the proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” and replace it with a fixed time period of admission for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. As a global talent strategy consultant, I have witnessed how immigration policy directly shapes national competitiveness in the knowledge economy, and this proposal represents a fundamental strategic miscalculation. This proposal represents a fundamental strategic error that prioritizes administrative convenience over national competitiveness. Creates Administrative Backlogs and Strain on USCIS\nRequiring thousands of additional extension of stay filings each year would overwhelm an already backlogged immigration system.\nI recommend establishing program-specific admission periods aligned with actual degree completion timelines, creating streamlined renewal processes for students in good academic standing, and implementing \"innovation visas\" for graduates in critical technology sectors. By forcing students into extension procedures mid-program, we risk disrupting critical research at precisely the moments when continuity is most essential for innovation. By contrast, this rule introduces mid-program uncertainty precisely when students are most vulnerable to competitive offers from other nations. Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit provides up to three years of work authorization immediately upon degree completion. Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit provides up to three years of work authorization with minimal bureaucratic friction. Australia's Temporary Graduate visa provides up to four years of work authorization for STEM graduates. As a specialist in global talent mobility and workforce development, I am particularly concerned about the proposal's fundamental misunderstanding of modern academic and professional pathways, which will severely undermine America's strategic position in the global talent competition. This policy fundamentally misunderstands the strategic nature of international talent competition and threatens America's position in the global knowledge economy. I submit this comment as a global talent strategy consultant to oppose the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. If any fixed terms are adopted, they should match actual academic program length plus practical training, retain the 60-day grace period, and allow SEVIS-based extensions validated by Designated School Officials and Responsible Officers without requiring USCIS filings in ordinary cases. DHS should maintain duration of status, strengthen SEVIS reporting, and use targeted enforcement against problem cases rather than impose blanket burdens on compliant students, and scholars. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. DHS itself estimates hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs each year and over two million additional hours of paperwork. This means compliant students will be forced into burdensome and risky extension filings with USCIS, exposing them to possible processing delays and technical denials. Finally, this rule will overwhelm USCIS with hundreds of thousands of new extension filings, compounding existing backlogs. However, I urge DHS to substantially revise or withdraw this proposal because, as drafted, it would impose significant and avoidable costs on international students, universities, and U.S. education funding ecosystems—while offering limited incremental security benefits beyond existing tools (SEVIS oversight, school recertification, targeted enforcement). 2) Operational and Financial Strain on Universities\n\nProgram rigidity that conflicts with academic norms: Provisions that curb graduate program changes and reduce grace periods are misaligned with real-world research timelines, advisor changes, lab delays, and cooperative education models—penalizing legitimate academic progress. Existing Authorities\n\nDHS already possesses targeted mechanisms—SEVIS data, school audits/recertification, site visits, fraud investigations, and individualized enforcement—to address bad actors. The Department of Homeland Security’s plan to impose fixed admission periods and mandatory extensions for international students, exchange visitors, and members of the foreign press is not only unnecessary — it is harmful, short-sighted, and un-American. Harm to the United States’ Global Competitiveness\n\nThe U.S. has long been the world’s top destination for international students. Real-World Human Consequences\n\nAs an international student currently working in the U.S. under STEM OPT, I would face severe uncertainty about my future under this rule. International students contribute tens of billions of dollars annually to the U.S. economy, support hundreds of thousands of jobs, and play critical roles in research and innovation. They pay billions in tuition and living expenses, support hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, and bring vitality to local communities across the country. The United States benefits when talented international students choose our institutions and contribute to our research, classrooms, and workplaces. Talent Competitiveness\n\nLoss of predictability and continuity: Replacing D/S with fixed end dates and requiring Extensions of Stay (EOS) adds adjudication risk to routine academic timelines, internships, and practical training. Work authorization friction: Conditioning lawful presence for post-completion training on an additional EOS adjudication creates a single point of failure for time-sensitive on-ramps (OPT/STEM OPT), diminishing the U.S. value proposition relative to peer destinations. A blanket shift to fixed admissions and routine EOS creates volume-driven adjudication noise that can obscure true risk signals rather than clarify them. I respectfully request DHS to withdraw the rule or adopt the modifications to minimize harm to students, universities, and the broader education funding ecosystem. DHS itself admits this rule will create hundreds of thousands of new extension requests every year. A Betrayal of American Values\n\nAmerica has always been strongest when it is open, confident, and willing to welcome people who want to contribute. If additional safeguards are deemed necessary, a targeted alternative would preserve integrity without stifling legitimate pathways: allow same- or lower-level enrollment when the student demonstrates a coherent professional objective, the program meets recognized quality standards, and a DSO attests to academic appropriateness; limit approvals to time-bounded programs with normal progress reported in SEVIS; and deny where credible evidence shows serial, unjustified program changes. Serial, unjustified program-hopping, non-attendance, and poor progress are already addressable through SEVIS oversight, fixed admission periods with extension-of-stay adjudications, accreditation standards, and routine evidence of bona fide study. I appreciate DHS’s interest in program integrity, but the proposal to prohibit post-completion enrollment in a program at the same or a lower educational level—and to sharply limit changes in educational objectives and early transfers—would cause serious, avoidable harm. RE: Public Comment on Docket DHS-2025-0250-0001\nOpposition to Replacement of Duration-of-Status with Fixed-Term Visas\n\nTo the Department of Homeland Security:\n\nAs a taxpaying H-1B visa holder who earned my master's degree in the United States, I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule replacing Duration-of-Status with fixed-term visas for international students and exchange visitors. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating duration of status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Instead of fixing these real problems, DHS wants to waste resources processing paperwork for students who are already vetted, monitored through SEVIS, and subject to ongoing institutional oversight. Every hour USCIS spends processing these needless extensions is an hour not spent reducing asylum backlogs, processing employment authorizations that businesses need, or investigating actual immigration fraud. USCIS is already drowning in backlogs—asylum cases sitting for years, employment authorization delays crippling businesses, processing times that are a national embarrassment. Operationally, the policy multiplies burdens precisely as other new processes (fixed admission periods and extension-of-stay filings) are added. As a global talent strategy consultant, I have observed how immigration policy directly impacts nations' competitive positioning in the international knowledge economy, and this proposal would fundamentally undermine America's strategic advantage. The Department's cost analysis acknowledges $390 million in direct costs but fails to account for the systemic delays and their multiplier effects on legitimate immigration processes. It will consume taxpayer resources, burden educational institutions, create obstacles for vetted individuals contributing to our society, and provide zero security benefit. Rather than this broad restriction, DHS should implement targeted risk-based screening, expand SEVIS real-time monitoring capabilities, and create streamlined digital extension processes for students in good standing. Now DHS wants to scrap this working system to create millions of additional paperwork requirements for USCIS to process. I recommend DHS adopt a \"talent track\" approach instead: maintain D/S for students in designated high-demand fields (STEM, healthcare, education), implement enhanced but streamlined reporting requirements through SEVIS upgrades, and create a \"bridge status\" allowing seamless transitions between academic and professional phases. Administrative Burden\n\nIncreased workload for institutions: Colleges and universities have emphasized that moving from “duration of status” to fixed terms of stay would require significantly more paperwork for Designated School Officials (DSOs) and compliance offices. The rule's prohibition on same-level degree changes particularly undermines modern career pathways where professionals increasingly need to combine technical expertise with complementary fields—such as engineers pursuing data science credentials or biologists adding business acumen. ICEB-2025-0001) eliminating \"duration of status\" for F, J, and I nonimmigrants from the perspective of global talent pipeline management and strategic workforce development. I submit these comments in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants (Docket No. Modern STEM careers require increasingly specialized, sequential skill acquisition that often spans 6-8 years from initial study through post-doctoral research and industry transition. Unlike the current D/S system where academic progress determines legal status, fixed periods create arbitrary deadlines disconnected from actual skill acquisition or labor market needs. Companies report they need 18-24 months to properly evaluate and integrate specialized talent—impossible when students face potential status disruptions every four years. Uncertainty for prospective students: International students may hesitate to commit to multi-year academic programs if there is a risk of having to leave mid-way due to visa expiration or administrative denials. My analysis of similar policy shifts in other jurisdictions reveals a consistent pattern: administrative uncertainty in student pathways correlates with measurable declines in applications within 18-24 months, followed by talent diversion to competitor destinations. Student Recruitment and Global Competitiveness\n\nReduced attractiveness of U.S. education: Higher-ed associations (e.g., NAFSA, ACE) have warned that limiting duration of stay could make the U.S. less appealing compared to countries with more flexible policies (like Canada, Australia, or the UK).\nCanada's Post-Graduation Work Permit provides up to three years of post-study authorization, while Australia's Temporary Graduate visa offers two to four years depending on qualification level. This approach would preserve America's competitive advantage in attracting global talent while addressing legitimate monitoring concerns through outcome-based rather than time-based metrics. As a workforce development policy analyst, I am deeply concerned about the severe mismatch between this proposal's rigid timelines and the evolving needs of America's labor market in the 21st century. The proposed four-year fixed admission period fundamentally misaligns with established talent development cycles in critical industries. Supporting Evidence:\n\nUSCIS Processing Times: Current I-20 processing and SEVIS updates often take 30-60 days\nAcademic Calendar Constraints: University admission cycles, particularly for graduate programs, typically span 6-12 months\nDocumentation Requirements: Gathering transcripts, recommendations, and other supporting materials requires substantial lead time\nOPT and CPT Applications: These work authorization processes alone can consume 90+ days\n\nReal-World Scenario: A student completing a Master's degree in May who wishes to begin a PhD program in the following January faces a 240-day window that barely accommodates standard university application timelines, even without processing delays. Impact Analysis:\n\nVisa Processing Delays: Current visa processing times at U.S. consulates worldwide often exceed 60-90 days, with some locations experiencing delays of 6+ months\nGeographic Limitations: Students from certain countries face limited consulate availability, requiring international travel just to reach a visa-issuing post\nEducational Continuity Disruption: Students would be forced to interrupt their studies to travel abroad for visa stamps, potentially missing entire academic terms\nEconomic Burden: Multiple visa applications create substantial financial hardship through repeated fees, travel costs, and accommodation expenses\n\nRecommendation: Maintain the current D/S system for students in good academic standing who remain within the scope of their original educational objective. The National Science Foundation data shows international students author 36% of patents filed by university researchers—innovation that requires multi-year continuity impossible under fixed admission periods. Rather than this disruptive overhaul, DHS should implement targeted reforms: establish risk-based monitoring using artificial intelligence to identify genuine compliance concerns, create fast-track extension processes for students in good standing, and develop bilateral agreements with key source countries for streamlined processing. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue evidence-based alternatives that strengthen both security and competitiveness. I urge DHS to withdraw this counterproductive rule and pursue evidence-based alternatives that strengthen both security and competitiveness. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on my analysis of global talent mobility patterns and comparative immigration policy effectiveness. Elimination of Duration of Status (D/S) Creates Unnecessary Barriers\n\nIssue: The proposed shift from Duration of Status (D/S) to fixed-term admission periods would require students to obtain new visa stamps for program changes or extensions, even when remaining at the same institution. Overly Restrictive Educational Pathway Limitations\nIssue: The proposed rule's restrictions on lateral and lower-level program changes contradicts legitimate academic and career development needs. Insufficient Grace Period Duration\nIssue: The proposed 240-day grace period fails to account for the realistic timelines required for academic and administrative processes. Recommendation: Extend the grace period to at least 365 days to provide realistic timeframes for legitimate academic transitions. The proposed uncertainty disrupts these network formation processes, with cascading effects on U.S. innovation capacity that extend far beyond individual visa holders. The proposed fixed-term system fundamentally misunderstands modern talent development cycles and risks triggering a catastrophic \"brain drain reversal.\" The current proposal abandons America's strategic advantage in global talent competition precisely when technological leadership demands the opposite approach. This proposal fundamentally misunderstands the global talent marketplace and positions the United States for catastrophic strategic disadvantage. The rule would replace duration-of-status (D/S) with a date-certain I-94 for F-1 and J-1 up to program end or four years (whichever is earlier), and for I nonimmigrants impose short admissions (240 days, and 90 days for PRC passport holders), with mandatory extension-of-stay (EOS) filings to continue. •\tThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires rules not be “arbitrary and capricious.” Capping admissions at four years, regardless of academic discipline, lacks a rational basis tied to actual program length data. The National Science Foundation’s Survey of Earned Doctorates reports median times across fields that exceed four years from doctoral program start and about six years from first graduate enrollment, which means many students would hit a mid-program immigration deadline that did not exist when they enrolled. The proposed shift from “Duration of Status” (D/S) to fixed admission periods creates unnecessary administrative burdens, undermines U.S. competitiveness in higher education, and may conflict with existing statutory purposes under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). A four-year cap is arbitrary and will force thousands of students into repeated Extension of Stay (EOS) filings. I write in opposition to DHS’s proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media” (Docket No. The proposal would trigger unlawful presence the day after an I-94 end date or after a denial, and it cuts the F-1 grace period to 30 days. The text confirms a four-year cap for most F-1/J-1 admissions and a new EOS process to continue beyond that cap; it also states F-1 grace would be cut to 30 days and clarifies that unlawful presence will run after the I-94 expires. It would also shorten the F-1 departure grace period from 60 to 30 days and cause unlawful presence to accrue after the I-94 end date. The notice frames the action as immigration control and security, but the main effect is to place new time limits and paperwork risks on people who entered the United States legally to study, conduct research, or report the news. A blanket shift to fixed I-94s for millions of lawful students and scholars is not well tied to that record. Nor does it fully address reliance by current students, J researchers, schools, and employers who planned timelines, funding, and staffing under D/S. Legal concerns under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). It will overburden USCIS, deter international talent, and create legal risk under the APA. The uncertainty of fixed stays and repeated EOS filings will deter top global talent from choosing U.S. universities, pushing them toward competitor nations (Canada, UK, Australia) with more stable visa systems. (https://www.nafsa.org/fall-2025-international-student-enrollment-outlook-and-economic-impact)\n\nAs we have seen, adding barriers will result in less students choosing to study in the U.S. International student enrollment keeps our communities strong, and changes that affect the ability of students to come and study in the U.S., such as the changes in this proposed rule, clearly have an adverse impact. (https://www.nafsa.org/policy-and-advocacy/policy-resources/nafsa-international-student-economic-value-tool-v2) The predicted decrease in enrollment due to other policies enacted this year, including travel bans and increased vetting of social media prior to visa issuance, is anticipated to \"result in nearly $7 billion in lost revenue and more than 60,000 fewer jobs.\" Adding additional barriers such as arbitrary deadlines on completion and additional complexities in receiving practical training after completing their programs will decrease the U.S.' attractiveness as a location for international students to complete their studies. As a college instructor at a public university in Cincinnati, Ohio, I strongly oppose the proposed rule to eliminate the \"duration of status\" framework for F, J, and I visa holders and replace it with fixed admission periods. Adding fixed admission periods will not significantly improve security but will certainly harm our educational institutions and the students we serve. The shift to fixed admission periods introduces uncertainty and stress for students whose academic journeys often require flexibility. According to research conducted by NAFSA, the professional organization for international educators, \"international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion and supported 378,175 jobs to the U.S. economy during the 2023-2024 academic year.\" For example, the UC College of Engineering and Applied Science has seen a 20% increase in international enrollment over the past five years, with many students contributing to federally funded research. Adding another layer of bureaucracy will make the U.S. less attractive compared to countries like Canada and the UK, which offer more streamlined and student-friendly immigration policies. (https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-phd-degree) After completing courses, PhD students must complete intensive research and a dissertation to finish their program. (https://www.newsweek.com/us-immigration-backlog-hits-all-time-high-2095846) The USCIS case processing website currently lists the processing time for F extension of stay as 3.5 months. (https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=569) For PhD students, the average time to degree completion is generally recognized as 4-7 years. Four years is an arbitrary number that does not consider the fact that each program may have different requirements that change the expected duration. If D/S is removed, this is sure to dramatically increase as demonstrated by other extension of stay categories, which currently have a 6.5 month processing time. SEVIS already monitors the duration of each program and the reasons that an extension is approved, so requiring an additional application to USCIS is doing double work for the same purpose.\nI submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed elimination of Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants, based on a comprehensive analysis of global talent mobility patterns and their strategic implications for American competitiveness. This proposal fundamentally misunderstands the strategic nature of international talent acquisition in today's knowledge-based global economy and will severely compromise America's position in the intensifying global competition for human capital. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and pursue targeted compliance solutions that preserve America's educational openness while addressing legitimate security concerns through data-driven, proportionate measures. I recommend DHS implement a risk-stratified approach instead: maintain D/S for students at research-intensive institutions with strong compliance records, while applying fixed periods only to institutions with demonstrated oversight failures. By creating systematic disruption points through mandatory extensions, the proposed rule will disproportionately impact precisely the long-term, research-intensive programs that produce America's most valuable human capital assets. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule published on August 28, 2025, titled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n\n⸻\n\n1. A comprehensive analysis should include multiplier effects—each international student generates approximately $36,000 annually in local economic activity beyond tuition. America Risks Losing Global Talent\n\nThe United States has been a dream destination for students around the world because of its reputation for world-class education and innovation. The current system provides the stability and flexibility students need to focus on academics, contribute to their communities, and ultimately give back to the United States. The uncertainty created by fixed admission periods will drive measurable talent diversion to competitor nations, representing billions in foregone economic gains that the current cost-benefit analysis completely ignores. For international students making multi-year educational investments often exceeding $200,000, the prospect of mid-program visa uncertainty will drive top-tier candidates toward competitor destinations. The proposed fixed admission periods create what economists call \"policy uncertainty shock\"—a phenomenon that systematically deters high-value decision-making. DHS estimates $99.3 million in costs over ten years, but this excludes the \"deadweight losses\" from foregone innovation, reduced university revenues, and decreased regional economic activity. I urge DHS to withdraw this rule and develop alternatives that strengthen oversight while preserving the flexible framework that has made U.S. higher education the global gold standard. Beyond the acknowledged $390 million in direct administrative costs, the rule will trigger substantial \"hidden multiplier effects.\" Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit program now offers up to three years of work authorization, while the UK's Graduate Route provides two years for bachelor's/master's graduates and three years for PhD holders. Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit program now offers up to three years of work authorization with clear pathways to permanent residence. We project a 15-20% decline in international student enrollment within three years of implementation, representing approximately $7.8 billion in lost economic activity. Alternatives to a Fixed Admission Period\n\nA balanced approach would preserve security oversight without destabilizing lawful students and workers:\n\nRetain D/S with Targeted Review: Continue using D/S, supplemented by periodic reviews via SEVIS, which already provides the oversight DHS cites as necessary (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 61, §III.A). Administrative Burden and Costs\n\nDHS itself estimates annualized costs of nearly $392 million over ten years, including burdens on nonimmigrants, schools, and sponsors (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 109, §IV.C). **Strategic Recommendations**\n\nRather than dismantling D/S, DHS should implement a \"smart compliance\" framework: establish risk-based monitoring using machine learning algorithms to identify genuine overstay risks while preserving flexibility for compliant students; create fast-track extension processes for students in designated STEM fields or critical research areas; and negotiate reciprocal agreements with allied nations to facilitate researcher mobility while maintaining security oversight. As a global talent strategy consultant who advises governments on immigration policy competitiveness, I can attest that this proposal would fundamentally undermine America's strategic position in the global talent economy. As a global talent strategy consultant who has advised governments on competitive immigration policies, I must emphasize that this proposal fundamentally misunderstands the modern dynamics of international talent competition and will severely damage America's strategic position. America's dominance in global innovation depends on continued access to international talent—this proposal would systematically erode that advantage precisely when geopolitical competition for intellectual capital intensifies. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating duration of status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. I submit this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule eliminating duration of status (D/S) for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. The proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants would immediately and profoundly destabilize my life and career. Given current international student enrollment of approximately 1.1 million, even a 10% deterrence rate would represent $4.4 billion in lost economic activity annually, far exceeding DHS's narrow cost projections. Personal and Professional Impact\n\nCareer Disruption: As someone who already struggled to access opportunities in the U.S. tech sector, this rule would jeopardize my ability to remain employed. It would create instability, emotional distress, and undermine America’s competitiveness in technology and innovation. We would be outsourcing our greatest asset—our ability to attract and retain global intellectual capital—ultimately shifting future economic growth and technological advancement away from the U.S.\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security to maintain the current Duration of Status framework, which has proven to be a successful and efficient system for decades. Furthermore, mandating extensions for a large portion of students would create an immense and unnecessary burden on USCIS, exacerbating existing backlogs and diverting resources from other critical immigration functions. The result would be an irreversible brain drain, with long-term consequences for U.S. competitiveness in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. Allowing Ph.D. students to transfer facilitates:\n\nCollaboration across diverse research environments\n\nBetter alignment between student expertise and institutional resources\n\nStronger mentorship and improved research outcomes\n\nBlocking transfers risks locking students into misaligned programs, which will diminish innovation output and slow America’s scientific progress at a time when global competition is more intense than ever. Subject: Urgent Appeal to Reconsider Restrictions on International Ph.D. Student Transfers\n\nI am writing as a concerned member of the U.S. academic community to express my deep opposition to the recent policy proposal that would restrict international Ph.D. students from transferring between universities during the course of their studies. By restricting international Ph.D. student transfers, we risk reversing decades of progress and ceding our leadership in innovation to other nations. The proposed fixed admission periods would position the United States as increasingly isolated in a global marketplace that demands flexibility and long-term commitment to international talent development. As an employee in a university setting, I am deeply concerned about the proposed rule to replace \"Duration of Status\" (D/S) with a fixed admission period. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) generates real-time compliance data tied directly to academic progress, creating a continuous monitoring framework that fixed admission periods cannot replicate. Conclusion\n\nThe United States became a global academic and technological powerhouse by welcoming the world’s brightest minds and fostering an environment of intellectual freedom and institutional flexibility. It undermines our nation’s long-standing commitment to academic freedom, discourages global talent from choosing the United States, and ultimately threatens America’s leadership in science, technology, and innovation. As a global talent strategy consultant who has advised governments and multinational corporations on international mobility frameworks, I am deeply concerned about the long-term strategic implications of this policy shift for America's position in the global knowledge economy. Additionally, implementing a digital-first extension process with predetermined approval criteria would address legitimate oversight concerns while maintaining the flexibility that makes American higher education globally competitive. This rule would force countless high-achieving students to navigate a costly and uncertain extension process simply to finish their degrees, risking the disruption of critical research projects and wasting immense academic and financial investment. Academic Freedom and Institutional Flexibility\n\nThe strength of American higher education lies in its diversity, mobility, and adaptability. Implementing a fixed visa duration with only a 30-day grace period, combined with a four-year limit, would place extreme pressure on students and create additional administrative burdens. Furthermore, the fixed visa duration, four-year limit, and 30-day grace period place undue stress on students, particularly those in STEM fields, and could limit research, internships, and academic exploration. These restrictions significantly undermine international students’ academic freedom and personal autonomy, violate fundamental human rights, and threaten the financial stability of U.S. institutions, as well as the local economies that rely on international students. The proposed rule to restrict student visas to 4 years would drive international students away from the United States and towards other countries instead, who would reap the economic benefits of hosting international students instead of us. As a result of the proposed rule, the United States will miss out on international students' economic contributions, on the jobs they create, and on the human capital they provide to U.S. businesses that allow them to be more globally competitive and technologically advanced. According to NAFSA, in the 2023–2024 academic year, international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported over 378,000 jobs. Furthermore, the current policy linking student visa validity to duration of status means that there is continuous oversight and monitoring of the international student population; international students and their sponsoring institutions keep their information updated in order to maintain their status.\nThe formal procedure required for extending a student visa past 4 years will make it extremely difficult for private businesses to hire recent graduates, who otherwise would be able to engage in productive post-graduate employment for a limited period of time through Optional Practical Training under their student visas. The proposed rule will have effects that conflict with the administration's stated policy goals, namely the goals of government efficiency, reducing the undocumented immigrant population, reducing red tape for businesses, and balance economic exchange with foreign nations. As a global talent strategy consultant who has analyzed international student mobility patterns across 40+ countries, I assert that this proposal fundamentally misunderstands how modern academic pathways function and will trigger a strategic talent hemorrhage to competitor nations. This proposal represents a strategic miscalculation that sacrifices long-term competitive advantage for administrative convenience, undermining decades of investment in positioning the United States as the premier destination for global talent. Forcing students to go elsewhere to continue their education causes the U.S. to lose tuition revenue, talent, diversity, and global reputation. The proposed rule will introduce new, additional applications for extending student visas and thus require unnecessary additional paperwork for USCIS agents to review. Based on current USCIS processing times averaging 8-12 months for I-539 applications, the agency would require an estimated 60% capacity increase to prevent systematic backlogs. Alternatively, extend the proposed maximum to seven years for doctoral programs, align with actual completion timelines, and create seamless transitions between academic and work authorization phases. This proposal also overlooks a critical barrier that already exists: current regulations often prevent international students from pursuing a Juris Doctor (JD) or PhD after completing a master’s degree, even when those advanced pathways are the logical next step for their career or academic development. The proposed restriction on F-1 students that would prevent them from pursuing a new degree program, particularly at the same or a different academic level, represents a fundamental limitation on academic freedom. Pursuing a second master’s often provides the most practical way to gain the specialized skills needed to succeed in American industries—for instance, transitioning from a purely academic background into applied fields such as data science, business analytics, or public policy. Maintaining a framework that allows international students to pursue additional degrees in the United States—consistent with their evolving educational and professional goals—better aligns with American values of opportunity, innovation, and openness. In sum, the proposed rule undermines academic freedom, imposes unnecessary burdens on both students and USCIS, and threatens to harm the U.S. economy and global standing in higher education. Additionally, requiring all students who wish to continue their studies to file for a new extension of stay through USCIS would impose an unsustainable administrative burden. Rather than wholesale D/S elimination, DHS should implement targeted reforms: establish enhanced monitoring protocols for specific high-risk programs while maintaining D/S for research-intensive fields; create expedited extension processes for STEM disciplines; and develop bilateral agreements with key partner countries for streamlined status transitions. Introducing mid-program visa uncertainty for these individuals creates institutional risk that research universities cannot afford, potentially forcing them to prefer domestic candidates for major projects regardless of merit—a fundamental departure from excellence-based selection. As a result, many talented individuals who aspire to higher research or legal training are effectively shut out. If second master’s degrees are also prohibited, international students would be left with virtually no pathway to continue their education in the United States, forcing them to leave and apply their talents elsewhere. Dear DHS,\n\nI am deeply concerned about the proposed amendment under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(ii)(C), which would prohibit F-1 students from enrolling in a second master’s degree program in the United States. For example, Designated School Officials could be required to justify the academic or professional necessity of a second program, or eligibility could be limited to degrees that expand into new disciplines or skill sets critical to workforce needs. As a global talent strategy consultant, I assess this proposal as fundamentally counterproductive to America's long-term competitive positioning in the global knowledge economy. China's recent launch of its National Smart Education Platform and expanded visa facilitation measures, combined with Canada's Post-Graduation Work Permit extensions and the EU's Blue Card reforms, creates an increasingly competitive landscape where administrative friction directly translates to talent loss. Restricting degree progression would reduce enrollment, diminish institutional revenues, and shift global talent to competitor nations that actively welcome students seeking to diversify or expand their academic backgrounds. As an international Ph.D. student in the United States, I am deeply disappointed and outraged by the proposed rule “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.” Doctoral research is never a linear process—it is full of exploration, trial and error, unexpected delays, and repeated revisions. This rule would do precisely that, creating unnecessary barriers that benefit our economic competitors while undermining decades of strategic investment in American higher education's global appeal. If implemented, this proposal will drive countless talented minds away from the United States and into countries that embrace their contributions, weakening the American research ecosystem and undermining the nation’s global competitiveness. As a global talent strategy consultant who has advised multinational corporations and governments on skilled migration policies for over two decades, I strongly oppose the proposed rule eliminating Duration of Status for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. As a concerned taxpayer and policy analyst focused on government efficiency, I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Recommendation\nRather than replacing D/S with fixed admission periods, DHS should:\n\nMaintain D/S for students in good standing with SEVP-certified institutions. Beyond direct USCIS processing costs, the rule would necessitate sophisticated compliance tracking systems at universities, require legal consultation services for students, and create coordination challenges between academic calendars and visa timelines. Policies that increase uncertainty and administrative burden will deter enrollment, especially among students from emerging economies. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to process millions of additional Extension of Stay (EOS) applications annually. By replacing D/S with rigid time limits, this proposal threatens to disrupt the academic lives of thousands of international students, forcing them to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on repeated extension applications, endure lengthy and uncertain adjudication processes, and risk having their studies cut short for reasons beyond their control. According to DHS’s own projections, the rule will generate over 2.3 million EOS filings per year, each requiring adjudication, biometric collection, and administrative review. Yet these timelines do not align with academic realities:\n\nDoctoral programs routinely exceed four years, requiring multiple EOS filings. Conclusion\nThe proposed rule imposes excessive costs on federal agencies and institutions, with little evidence of improved oversight or public benefit. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to enhance oversight, this rule represents a costly and inefficient use of public funds with minimal return on investment. A 5% drop in international enrollment would cost U.S. institutions over $2 billion annually. The proposed rule to replace “Duration of Status” with fixed admission periods and require additional extension-of-stay filings for OPT and STEM OPT applicants may appear procedural, but its impact on U.S. universities would be profound and damaging. Comment in Strong Opposition to the Proposed Rule\n\nI strongly oppose the proposed F-1 regulation introducing a 4-year cap on study duration and restricting students from switching majors or pursuing additional degrees at the same or lower level. I respectfully oppose the proposed rule that would replace “duration of status” (D/S) admission with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. I urge DHS to reconsider and maintain policies that make the United States the destination of choice for the brightest minds, ensuring that our universities — and the nation they serve — remain competitive in an increasingly interconnected world. I urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and engage with universities and student representatives to design policies that ensure both oversight and flexibility, while preserving the United States’ global competitiveness. This proposal would increase that burden, create instability for students like me, and risk undermining the very educational opportunities that draw international talent to the United States. My own experience—paying heavily but receiving little tangible outcome—illustrates how rigid deadlines can leave students stranded with debt but without the degree or training they sought. Unnecessary Administrative Burden\nThe proposed extension of stay (EOS) process would require immigration officers to re-adjudicate cases that are already monitored through SEVIS, where schools and program sponsors report students’ compliance. My personal experience of paying heavily yet receiving little benefit underscores the danger of layering more financial and administrative burdens. Graduate STEM programs, in particular, are sustained by international students who choose the U.S. because it offers clear pathways from education to practical training and research opportunities. Over time, enrollment in U.S. universities would decline, particularly in advanced STEM fields where international students often make up the majority of graduate cohorts. The 4-Year Cap Is Unrealistic and Disruptive\nDoctoral programs in the U.S. routinely take 5–7 years, particularly in STEM fields. Loss of Global Talent and Innovation Leadership\nTalented students will not tolerate such uncertainty when alternative destinations—Canada, the U.K., Australia—offer more stable and student-friendly visa frameworks. This proposal risks pushing the next generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs out of the U.S., eroding the nation’s long-standing leadership in education, innovation, and research. Economic and Institutional Harm\nInternational students are not just learners; they are essential contributors to the U.S. economy, paying tuition, supporting local communities, and driving research output.\nExecutive Summary\nAs a U.S.-based professor in a STEM discipline, I oppose this proposed rule because it would impose unnecessary administrative burdens, disrupt vital academic research, and undermine the ability of the United States to attract and retain the brightest international talent. Negative Impact on Academic Excellence and Research Innovation\n\nThis policy would impose rigid time limits on international students and scholars, undermining the very nature of academic study and research. Imposing arbitrary admission limits risks forcing talented students and researchers to abandon their programs prematurely, which would disrupt ongoing research and weaken the global standing of U.S. universities. I respectfully submit this statement in opposition to the proposed rule, “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media.”\n\n⸻\n\n1. By replacing “duration of status” (D/S) with fixed admission periods, the rule threatens to harm higher education and weaken U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I respectfully oppose the proposed rule to replace “duration of status” (D/S) with a fixed time period of admission for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. Many doctoral programs require 5–7 years to complete; truncating student status to four years creates uncertainty and risks forcing talented students to abandon projects critical to U.S. innovation. Administrative Burdens and Costs\nThe proposed rule would require frequent extension of stay applications (EOS), imposing additional costs on both students and institutions. DHS itself estimates annualized costs of $390+ million over ten years (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 110, Summary of Costs). •\tProvide a safe harbor for students and exchange visitors with timely filed extensions, so they are not penalized for adjudication delays. Cutting short these pathways forces talented students into repetitive extension applications, creating unnecessary administrative bottlenecks. Additional restrictions provide little added security benefit, while creating significant disruption to educational institutions and individuals. Better Alternatives Exist\nInstead of eliminating D/S, DHS could:\n\nRetain D/S while strengthening oversight through the existing SEVIS system (already mandated under IIRIRA and expanded after 9/11) (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 73, SEVIS framework). I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw this proposal and preserve the D/S system with targeted oversight improvements. I urge DHS to withdraw the proposal and instead pursue reforms that preserve D/S with enhanced compliance measures. Comment Opposing Proposed Rule on Fixed Time Period of Admission and Education Restrictions for F-1 Students\n\nExecutive Summary\nI respectfully oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to restrict academic students (F-1) from pursuing additional programs at the same educational level (e.g., a second master’s degree) (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 64, §214.2(f)). Conclusion\nThe proposed prohibition on pursuing additional degrees at the same educational level is unreasonable, harmful to students and universities, and inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom and career development. Practical Alternatives\nInstead of banning additional degrees at the same level, DHS could:\n\t•\tRetain the existing Duration of Status (D/S) framework with oversight through SEVIS, as already mandated by law (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 47, SEVIS monitoring requirements). ICEB-2025-0001)\n\nExecutive Summary\nI respectfully oppose the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) and impose fixed periods of admission for F, J, and I nonimmigrants. To Whom It May Concern,\n\nAs a concerned U.S. taxpayer who cares deeply about the international reputation of the United States and the responsible use of public resources, I am writing to express strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate the Duration of Status (D/S) policy for international students and replace it with fixed-term visas. Comment Opposing DHS Proposed Rule: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants (Docket No. Conclusion\nThe proposed shift from D/S to fixed periods of admission risks major talent losses for U.S. employers, imposes unnecessary administrative costs, and undermines America’s ability to attract and retain the world’s best students and professionals. Limiting degree pathways risks decreasing U.S. universities’ global competitiveness and may drive talented students to choose alternative destinations such as Canada, the UK, or Australia, which do not impose such restrictions (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 72, Regulatory Impact Analysis). I urge DHS to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the current D/S policy for the sake of administrative efficiency, national interest, and global goodwill. I respectfully urge DHS to withdraw or revise this provision and instead adopt targeted oversight mechanisms that maintain program integrity without denying legitimate academic and professional pathways. Creating a safe harbor for timely filed extensions, so students and employers are not penalized for USCIS processing delays. •\tImplement safe harbor protections for students who timely file for program changes or extensions, ensuring good-faith compliance. If their ability to lawfully remain becomes contingent on fixed, short admissions with repeated extension applications, companies will face sudden disruptions in workforce stability. For example, many highly skilled professionals at companies such as Amazon.com remain in F-1/OPT because they have not secured H-1B status. In particular, it risks driving away highly skilled graduates who contribute substantially to the U.S. economy but remain in F-1 status due to limited H-1B visa availability."

However, two elements of the proposal would unintentionally undermine U.S. higher education, scientific innovation, and student well-being. I respectfully recommend:\n1.Permit subsequent study at the same degree level in a different discipline (with appropriate guardrails). 2.Do not fix admission for F/J students at 4 years; retain D/S or set initial admissions to empirically realistic program lengths with automatic, low-burden continuation in status when timely extensions are filed. The empirical mismatch: U.S. data show most doctoral students require ~6 years from start of graduate school to the PhD (and ~8.6 years since bachelor’s). Academic and mental-health costs of forced mid-program EOS: Student mental-health indicators are already strained: recent national surveys report 13–15% suicidal ideation in the past year among college students, with high baseline stress. Visa-policy uncertainty itself has been shown to negatively affect international students’ psychological well-being and adjustment. Impact on U.S. Competitiveness: The proposed changes may deter talented international students, scholars, and journalists from choosing the United States as their destination. Economic and Workforce Contributions\nInternational students are not a marginal part of the economy. I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination. Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

         "in Computer Science to enroll in a second master’s in a distinctly different field (e.g., chemistry, medicine-adjacent biosciences, finance), so long as (a) the new program’s CIP code represents a non-duplicative field; (b) the Designated School Official (DSO) certifies good standing and full-time enrollment; and (c) the student meets all existing SEVIS reporting and financial requirements. In addition to individual cases, outcomes research on the U.S. MD-PhD pathway—our most formal dual-discipline training—shows sustained research leadership, validating the policy value of allowing sequential or combined training across fields. • Shinya Yamanaka, MD, PhD (Kyoto/UCSF) shared the 2012 Nobel for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), transforming regenerative medicine—again, dual medical and doctoral training. Guardrails, not prohibitions: Rather than categorically restricting same-level study changes, DHS can require DSO attestation that the second degree is (1) non-duplicative (distinct 4- or 2-digit CIP), (2) academically justified, and (3) pursued in good standing. Peer-reviewed work in Science finds that “atypical combinations” of prior knowledge predict higher-impact papers—precisely the kind of synthesis enabled when a student adds a second same-level degree in a different discipline. I respectfully recommend:\n1.Permit subsequent study at the same degree level in a different discipline (with appropriate guardrails). 2.Do not fix admission for F/J students at 4 years; retain D/S or set initial admissions to empirically realistic program lengths with automatic, low-burden continuation in status when timely extensions are filed. • Retain D/S for F/J students; or\n• Set initial admission to program length plus a reasonable buffer (e.g., I-20 end date + 12–18 months), with automatic in-status continuation upon timely EOS filing—no disruption to SEVIS, travel signatures, on-campus eligibility, or academic participation while pending.

ICEB-2025-0001, OMB Control Number 1653-0038\nComment Opposing DHS Proposed Rule to Eliminate Duration of Status (D/S) for F, J, and I Visa Holders\n\nI respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule to eliminate the “Duration of Status” (D/S) framework for F, J, and I nonimmigrant visa categories and replace it with fixed periods of admission. In conclusion, I urge DHS to reconsider this proposal and preserve the Duration of Status framework. The proposal: The NPRM would replace “Duration of Status” with a fixed four-year admission for most F/J nonimmigrants. A more balanced approach would maintain program integrity while continuing to support the United States’ role as a global leader in education, journalism, and cultural exchange. Requiring time-sensitive EOS filings—often near finals—adds avoidable, policy-induced uncertainty to an already high-risk period. Rationale: The U.S. research enterprise consistently shows that integrating knowledge across fields increases scientific impact. § 214.2(f)(5)(i): “…admitted until the program end date, not to exceed 5 years…”\n\n§ 214.2(f)(5)(ii)(A)–(E): Replace the graduate-level ban with: “One change of educational objective at the graduate level is permitted upon DSO certification of good standing, continuity of study, and SEVIS update; additional changes require SEVP approval.”\n\n§ 214.2(f)(5)(v): Retain “60 days” (or revise to “45 days”) for the departure period. Instead of a categorical ban, allow one same-level graduate program change (or a change within the first academic year) when the DSO certifies good standing and continued full-time study, with notice in SEVIS and, if needed, an EOS. For these reasons, policymakers should reject this change and instead strengthen pathways that allow international students to contribute to the United States’ long-term prosperity. International students, particularly those pursuing specialized STEM master’s programs like the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) or broad management degrees such as the Master of Business Administration (MBA), are essential to the U.S. high-skilled labor pipeline. Limiting their ability to complete both a specialized STEM degree and an MBA would directly reduce this retention rate, shrinking the skilled labor pool at a time when U.S. businesses already face shortages. Conclusion\nThe proposed rule to replace “duration of status” with fixed admission periods risks forcing students into a false choice between technical STEM programs and MBAs. Because of its STEM classification, graduates are eligible for up to 36 months of Optional Practical Training (OPT), giving employers time to retain talent in high-demand fields such as finance, consulting, and technology (Mim-Essay, 2024). More than half of all international students study STEM fields, and about 20% of them remain in the U.S. labor force after graduation, compared with near-zero retention rates for non-STEM graduates (National Bureau of Economic Research [NBER], 2022). ICEB–2025–0001 — Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for F, J, and I Nonimmigrants\n\nDear Sir/Madam:\n\nI write as an F-1/STEM OPT professional in a STEM field and as a graduate of a U.S. university. Curtailing international students’ ability to pursue them fully would harm the economy, deepen labor shortages, and cede global advantage to competing nations. In 2023–2024, they contributed $43.8 billion and supported over 378,000 U.S. jobs (Association of American Universities [AAU], 2024). New analysis shows international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy in 2023–24. Please allow same-level changes where the DSO attests continuity toward a coherent educational/professional objective, with SEVP oversight as needed, rather than forcing a higher-level only rule. However, several aspects of the proposal would unnecessarily hinder bona fide students and weaken U.S. competitiveness in advanced technology fields. 3) Permit limited same-level transitions in bona fide cases. In summary, I respectfully recommend:\n\nExtend the proposed maximum stay to five or six years under 8 CFR 214.2\n\nRetain the current 60 day grace period, or reduce it only to 45 days\n\nConsider the significant economic contributions of international students when finalizing the rule\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nB.B. For these reasons, I respectfully urge DHS to reconsider or substantially modify the proposed rule to maintain strong oversight while preserving the flexibility necessary for academic success, research productivity, and U.S. competitiveness. While I understand the intent to create clearer timelines and enhance oversight, I respectfully urge DHS to extend the maximum period to five or six years. Comment on Proposed Rule: Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Students and Exchange Visitors\n\nI appreciate the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to ensure oversight of the F and J visa programs. I appreciate the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to maintain oversight of nonimmigrant programs, and I understand that establishing fixed admission periods in place of “Duration of Status” (D/S) may seem like a reasonable step. However, I am concerned that the proposed shift from “duration of status” to fixed periods of admission, combined with a new extension process, will create significant challenges without clear benefits. However, I would like to highlight several concerns about how this proposal could impact international students, U.S. higher education, and the long-term competitiveness of the United States. If international talent turns away from the U.S. toward more supportive countries, the long-term loss of innovation, economic growth, and cultural exchange will hurt the United States far more than the short-term administrative challenges this rule seeks to address. Introducing uncertainty into their visa status will make U.S. institutions less attractive compared to competitor countries with more flexible frameworks, weakening our higher education and innovation ecosystems. If international students cannot pursue second master’s programs to pivot into these areas, U.S. employers will lose out on exactly the talent that is supposed to drive these initiatives. The DHS proposed rule, particularly the “educational level limitation” noted on page 138, would close off the option for students to pursue a second master’s degree. If that happens, U.S. institutions and the broader economy will lose access to highly skilled individuals, weakening America’s position in the global education and innovation market. Rigid admission periods risk disrupting or prematurely ending academic work if extensions are delayed or denied. Requiring mid program extensions places an additional burden both on students and on USCIS processing. The need to file frequent extensions will add stress, legal risk, and financial cost. Specifically, the potential narrowing of employer eligibility under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, alterations to Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans such as Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and efforts to “streamline” financial aid regulations may all have significant negative implications—not only for students and alumni, but for the university community as a whole. To Whom It May Concern: \nAs a dedicated staff member at D’Youville University, I am writing to express deep concern regarding several proposed changes to federal student aid and loan repayment policies.\nIf PAYE and ICR are weakened, it could lead to: \n•\tIncreased student anxiety and stress, which I already witness during financial aid season, \n•\tHigher loan default rates, which could affect institutional accountability metrics and access to Title IV funding, \n•\tAnd fewer students enrolling in graduate programs, limiting their upward mobility and professional growth. As a staff member who supports career services and student advising, I worry this change would: \n•\tDissuade students from pursuing mission-driven careers, especially in underserved communities,\n•\tNegatively impact enrollment in fields tied to public service, such as teaching, nursing, and counseling,\n•\tAnd reduce the morale of students and graduates, who may feel betrayed by a system they trusted. Weakening these regulations could: \n•\tUndermine our ability as staff to guide students confidently, due to unclear or changing rules, \n•\tReduce trust in the financial aid system, especially for first-generation or underserved students, \n•\tAnd harm our institution’s reputation, if we are lumped together with less ethical programs that benefit from deregulation. Streamlining Federal Student Aid Regulations \nWhile simplifying bureaucracy can be beneficial, there is a real danger in doing so at the cost of transparency and oversight. 3) As with F nonimmigrants, setting the length of the J nonimmigrant's specific program to not exceed a 4-year period would establish a mechanism for immigration officers to assess these nonimmigrants at defined periods (such as when applying for an EOS in the United States beyond a 4-year admission period) and determine whether they are complying with the conditions of their classification\n    This seems like an unneeded bureaucratic step, again if the problem is that there are becoming too many students to manage then how will adding this evaluation process make it easier to manage on top of everything else that is already happening? I understand that this may lead to people staying here for an extended period of time, but one point was made that after completing these higher education programs there was a nitpick about people enrolling in language training programs. however, I do not understand how the proposed change will actually make it easier to monitor these individuals. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. From the student sitting in my office worried about debt, to the faculty member preparing the next generation of nurses or teachers, to the university as a whole striving to uphold its mission—these policies matter. From the perspective of someone who works closely with students daily, I see firsthand how these policies impact their lives and educational journeys. PSLF is often a deciding factor for students who choose to enter lower-paying, high-impact professions. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Permit students to pursue a second master’s degree in a different discipline, provided that they demonstrate academic progress and a legitimate educational purpose. However, I am concerned about the proposed rule that would block students from pursuing a second master’s degree or another degree at the same level. I respectfully urge DHS to revise the proposal to ensure it both protects the F-1 program’s integrity and preserves fair access to higher education. This adjustment would be more faithful to the INA’s text and purpose, while also aligning with the Higher Education Act’s commitment to expanding educational opportunity. Further, the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. Please consider the EPA report  \"An Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska\" (Report) as you reconsider the Clean Water 404(c) determination. In addition to Sockeye Salmon, Bristol Bay and the watershed support one of the world's largest remaining wild Chinook Salmon runs and healthy Coho, Chum and Pink Salmon runs. This Report provides an indispensable resource to inform decision-makers of the costs, benefits, and risks to public salmon resources from proposed mining activities in Bristol Bay. As constructive suggestions, I respectfully recommend:\n\t•\tPreserving the “duration of status” option for students in good standing;\n\t•\tMaintaining the 60-day grace period;\n\t•\tAllowing program or school changes with DSO approval and SEVIS notification. However, I believe that the way these changes are currently structured could negatively affect not only individual students, but also thousands of people and families with ongoing academic and immigration processes, as well as impact educational institutions and local economies. Respectfully, I wish to express my concerns regarding the proposal to impose fixed durations of stay, reduce the grace period, and restrict changes of program or school for F-1 and J-1 visa holders. Tailings dams have failed in other areas, such as in 2014, when Imperial Metals Corporation's Mount Polley copper-gold mine tailings dam failed, sending 24 million cubic meters of water and mine tailings downstream into a tributary of British Columbia's Fraser River with contamination reaching previously pristine Quesnel Lake.The facts warrant deep considerationImperial Metals Corporation is an established Canadian mining firm, the mine and tailings dam were built to modern technical standards, the tailings were not acid-generating, and the breach occurred on a sunny summer day, not after an earthquake or a major storm event. The Mount Polley Mine tailings dam was the same type of tailings dam proposed for Pebble Mine, but the Pebble Mine and associated dams are projected to be more than 100 times larger than Mount Polley, will be in a geologically and hydrologically less stable area, and in acid generating rock. Given those facts and the best available scientific information, the potential exists for a more serious catastrophe at Pebble Mine than what is ongoing at Mount Polley. Constraining this pipeline by eliminating D/S would reduce the availability of such talent, discourage employers from investing in U.S.-based expansion, and inadvertently push high-value work abroad. Balanced policies that ensure security and predictability will benefit both the immigration system and the United States’ academic reputation as a destination of educational excellence. It is unlikely that Pebble Mine will be able to operate in this area without harming the rivers and the salmon that depend on them, and such impacts would be catastrophic to this unique, pristine fishery. From a cost and compliance perspective, employing international graduates is not a shortcut, but rather a highly regulated process with rigorous oversight. As an employer in the United States, I have directly observed the crucial role international students play in maintaining a competitive and efficient workforce.\nInternational graduates, on the other hand, often bring specialized skills in STEM and other critical fields and deliver them with efficiency and commitment, making them indispensable to employers seeking to remain competitive in fast-moving industries. I urge the USCIS to consider the impact this rule change might make on the lives of current students enrolled in programs and also on how it might impact students considering the US as their educational destination, and not limit the duration of stay to four years or cut short some of the practical training opportunities these students may receive currently. I respectfully urge DHS to reconsider this proposal, as it does not reflect the reality of how students plan their educational journeys and seek continuous improvement through multiple programs of study. I urge DHS to consider modifications that balance oversight with the legitimate academic and career needs of international students. Docket Number: ICEB-2025-0001\n\nComment:\n\nI am submitting comments regarding the proposed rule to establish fixed periods of admission for F-1 students. Fixed admission periods mean I would need to file multiple extensions, wasting valuable time and resources that could otherwise be dedicated to my studies and research. The proposed replacement of the duration of status system with fixed admission terms would have cascading effects far beyond universities. In light of these points, I suggest that general intensive English programs be given a maximum of three years, with the possibility of extensions for students pursuing English for Specific Purposes, provided these align with their declared academic goals. English for Specific Purposes (ESP) programs—such as those focused on Business, Nursing, Marketing, Academic Writing, or preparation for standardized tests like the TOEFL—serve vital roles in helping students prepare for further academic or career pursuits. From both an academic and pedagogical perspective, two years is often insufficient to successfully complete a general intensive English program, especially when measured against international standards such as the CEFR framework. While I understand DHS’s intent to improve oversight, I am concerned about the potential negative impacts on international students and U.S. higher education:\n\t1. Regarding DHS docket number ICEB-2025-0001, Section III.B, I write as a person with experience in both education and public policy. At the same time, from a national security perspective, discouraging international students from coming to the United States would weaken our long-term strategic advantage. Limiting Day-1 CPT or reducing post-completion OPT may undermine career preparation and deter students from pursuing advanced degrees in the U.S.\n\t3. For example, pursuing another program such as an MBA or a second master’s degree in a different field allows them to broaden their knowledge, develop leadership skills, and prepare for future challenges. As an international student currently pursuing a PhD, I oppose this proposed rule because it creates uncertainty in my academic journey. NAFSA (2022–23) — Texas hosted 63,000+ international students; $2.2B economic impact; 23,200 jobs supported. These students contributed $2.2 billion to the Texas economy and supported 23,200 jobs. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators:\n\nIn 2022–23, Texas hosted over 63,000 international students, the 3rd highest in the nation. If the student was given an entry time of only roughly 2-years, per their Associate I-20, and then told to exit and re-enter (including oftentimes applying for a new visa), or to apply for an extension for the new bachelor's program, that would increase the workload for all offices related to immigration (DSO's working for the schools, USCIS processing extensions, DoS for processing new visas for students who otherwise would have remained, CBP for reviewing frequent re-entries). This rule would make it considerably more difficult for community colleges within the US to recruit and enroll international students, and for those that they did, it would create a huge increase in work for USCIS and CBP officers, as well as DSO's. Families ask us all the time, “Will my child be able to finish their program here without problems?” With this change, the honest answer might become “we don’t know.” That uncertainty could easily push talented students to choose countries where the rules feel clearer and friendlier. Increased Extension Burdens Will Hurt Texas Institutions\n\nDHS acknowledges its proposal will increase extension filings (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 34, §II.C). Proposed Rule PDF, p. 34, §II.C — DHS expects surge in extension filings. I. Texas Heavily Relies on International Students\n\nThe rule assumes most programs can be completed in four years (Proposed Rule PDF, p. 22, §I.B). Risks to Texas Workforce and Innovation\n\nTexas depends on international students to sustain its STEM workforce and innovation economy:\n\nThe National Science Foundation reports that international students earn more than half of U.S. doctoral degrees in engineering and computer science. NSF — international students earn >50% of U.S. doctoral degrees in engineering and computer science\n\nICEB-2025-0001-0001 International students and exchange visitors are essential to Texas’s higher education system and economy. Comment Opposing Fixed Admission Period Rule (RIN 1653–AA95)\n\nExecutive Summary\nI respectfully oppose DHS’s proposal to replace “duration of status” with a fixed four-year admission period for F, J, and I students. Practical Alternatives\n\nDHS can achieve oversight without harming Texas’s economy by:\n\nPreserving the Duration of Status (D/S) model, which ties lawful stay to full-time enrollment. Retaining the Duration of Status system, while strengthening the reporting process, would not only preserve America’s leadership in global education but also address security needs in a more balanced and fair manner. October 17, 2017\n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency\nRE: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369 \n \nI vehemently oppose Scott Pruitt's proposal that would allow Pebble Limited Partnership access to the beautiful Bristol Bay region - home to fisherman, a $200 million salmon industry, and its spectacular rivers teeming with aquatic life. As a young member of the American Fisheries Society (AFS), and a fisheries biologist, formerly working in Alaska myself, I object to the withdrawal of the proposed determination and plead that the EPA use its authority to prevent the elimination and/or impairment of waters and wetlands supporting the extraordinarily prolific, sustainable, all-wild Bristol Bay salmon fisheries. Please consider the more developed thoughts and opinions of my supervisors in the AFS, who wrote this well constructed letter to Scott Pruitt and the EPA : https://fisheries.org/2017/10/afs-objects-to-epas-withdrawal-of-pebble-mine-determination/\n\nAnd please consider my opinion as you go forward with this decision. Not only is the Bristol Bay salmon fishery an incredible and sustainable economic powerhouse of our state, it also provides so many of those things that can't be measured -- a sense of place and belonging, truly sustainable vocational work, economic independence for those who depend on it, a connection to our food, an opportunity for kids to grow up knowing how to work hard, environmental stewardship. I was born and raised in Homer, Alaska and grew up taking the Bristol Bay salmon fishery for granted. In a world where technology accelerates so much faster than many people can keep up with, the Bristol Bay salmon fishery is a constant for so many of us. This proposed rule does not increase efficiency but creates more work for the government to regulate and process visas for international students and scholars who are otherwise engaged in fully lawful and economically beneficial activities in our universities and communities. The shift from \"duration of status\" to a fixed-term admission for F and J visa holders, with mandatory extensions, would impose a significant and counterproductive burden on our academic community and our international students. If anything, the agency should propose a rule to increase the amount of time that students can stay after completing their degrees and maintain the current rule of duration of status. However, the restrictions on transferring schools and the limitations on pursuing a second master's degree at the same level do not make sense. If this policy is adopted in the future, it could lead to thousands of students transferring to other countries, resulting in a loss of job opportunities and revenue for US educational institutions. For instance, the policy could prohibit \"Day 1 CPT universities,\" which accept transfer students or students who have completed a degree at the same level. My friends who grew up working on their family's commercial boats learned discipline and hard work and could see an economic future for themselves from an early age. Graduate students pursuing master's or doctoral degrees would be even more affected, as these programs often have variable and extended timelines for research and dissertation work. Ultimately, it seems this change would not enhance security, but instead would unnecessarily complicate and undermine the very academic mission that these visa programs are designed to support. The EPA should move forward with its Proposed Determination (PD) under Clean Water Act Section 404(c) to protect the Bristol Bay Watershed. EPA should move forward on this PD because it already followed an extensive public process on this matter, and it is a waste of government resources to ignore the existing scientific work and its conclusions and to begin a new project review process. The process to date - with EPA's publication of the Final Bristol Bay Assessment in January 2014 -- was a fair process and compliant with the Clean Water Act. ICEB-2025-0001, OMB Control Number 1653-0038\n\nThe proposed regulatory changes concerning the H-1B program, particularly the limitations on the cap and the strict filing timelines, may inadvertently hinder the ability of U.S. employers to respond flexibly to labor market needs.\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am writing in opposition to the proposed rule to replace “Duration of Status” (D/S) with a fixed time period of admission for F-1 students, J-1 exchange visitors, and other academic nonimmigrant categories. This rule would create unnecessary barriers to education and cultural exchange in the United States, while undermining the country’s ability to attract global talent. As a current PhD student, I would like to point out that the four-year time limit under the new DHS rule does not reflect the reality of doctoral education. Most of these graduates begin working while on OPT, but since earning a PhD often takes more than four years, the current time limits don’t reflect reality. I work in a small town in Texas, and honestly, this DHS plan to get rid of Duration of Status for F and J visa holders (that ICEB-2025-0001 thing) got me really worried. She still has to work a second job, but is able to make her loan payments, pay her rent, buy her groceries, lease a car, in short—live her life. A physical therapist does not make a salary that will allow someone to pay off this amount of debt in full--let alone buy a home, save for retirement, have a family! The PAYE plan has made it possible for her to make all her loan payments on time. EPA concluded that mining operations would cause unacceptable adverse effects on fish and animal habitats in the Bristol Bay Watershed. The EPA conducted a thorough, multiyear scientific investigation of the Bristol Bay Watershed and potential impacts from the mining proposals. Large scale mining operations should not be located in the sensitive and unique ecosystems of Bristol Bay. I urge the Department of Homeland Security and all involved decision-makers to seriously consider creating green card pathways for international students, especially in STEM fields. I want to emphasize one part of the proposed rule that I find especially concerning: the restriction in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(ii) that would prohibit graduate students, including Ph.D. students, from transferring to another program or institution. ICEB-2025-0001]\nRIN 1653-AA95\n\nIn reference to the proposed rule change, while some aspects are understandable, a 4 year time frame is too short. Permitting 5 years for a BS degree and 6 years for the advanced degrees (and maybe more for medical school candidates because of internship and residency requirements) would make sense both for the government and for the individuals who are students. The proposed 4 year time limit presents an administrative burden on both the government and the individual students. The average time to obtain a Ph.D. in a STEM field is certainly more like 5 to 5.5 years depending on discipline. This would prevent the country from recruiting the world's top talent, which is essential for conducting the critical research needed to maintain the U.S.'s leading position in science and innovation. RE: 2025-16554 (90 FR 42070)\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n8 CFR Parts 214, 248, and 274a\n[DHS Docket No. Blocking them from transferring does not serve security or compliance goals, it only disrupts research and discourages talented scholars from choosing the United States. Please keep the current Duration of Status policy and reject this proposed rule change. Sometimes a research project shifts direction, sometimes a program no longer offers the resources a student needs, and sometimes an advisor moves to another institution. Enforcing a fixed 4-year limit on F1 student visas isn't in the United States' best interest. The recent restrictions on COVID vaccines make it harder for people who want protection to get it. Keep COVID vaccination on the shared decision-making list so that patients and clinicians can decide together when additional doses are needed. Maintain a clear recommendation that COVID vaccines are appropriate for all, beginning with a full series of doses for initial protection. As a doctor working in an underserved area, I support PSLF and the IDR payment plans because they're a key part of encouraging others in the healthcare field to work in areas of need. •\tFlexibility & Adaptation: People often discover new career interests after completing a first master’s; the rule assumes fixed career paths and does not reflect real-life educational trajectories. Many students pursue a second master’s (e.g., a specialized MBA after a technical master’s) to gain practical skills, specialize, or advance their careers. PSLF and IDR payment plans allow doctors like me the ability to care for the most vulnerable and needy populations while also decreasing the burden of the cost it took for us to get there. If the new regulation is implemented, most PhD students would need to apply for a status extension midway through their program. Students who need more time can still apply for extensions later in their program, but this change would help streamline the process and reduce unnecessary workload for all parties involved. In allowing mining in this area, it would affect not only the salmon in the bay but would have great repercussions for the entire Bristol Bay community and the rest of the world since Bristol Bay salmon comprises the largest wild salmon fishery in the entire world. The Bristol Bay salmon fishing industry brings in 1.5 billion dollars annually, so if the salmon habitat was destroyed and the population depleted it would negatively impact the entire United States economy. PSLF and IDR payment plans are reasons why someone may choose a non-profit in the first place over something that compensates more but has less societal impact. A more practical solution for PhD programs would be to set the initial fixed end date on the I-20 to five years, instead of four. The proposed substitution of D/S with a fixed end date on the I-20 appears to be designed with undergraduate and master’s students in mind, whose programs typically fall within a four-year time frame. For example, while relatively \"easier\" degree programs can be finished in 4 years, engineering and highly technical programs requiring students to complete rigorous courses typically require 5-6 years. Despite the fact the governmental regulations permitted this company to \"safely\" dispose of their waste in the river. We already hire local candidates whenever possible and provide opportunities to people in our community. The fact that fishermen, the Alaskan community, scientists and the government have all worked together for centuries to protect this fish is truly amazing. Additionally, the removal of references to completing a course of study could reduce flexibility for students engaging in non-traditional or multidisciplinary programs, potentially discouraging legitimate international students and affecting the diversity of U.S. educational institutions. International students bring a wide range of perspectives, experiences, and skills that enrich academic programs and research. Supporting international students strengthens U.S. universities and promotes global leadership in education and research. Movement within the same level after completion of a program or to a lower educational level raises concerns regarding whether the F-1 alien is a bona fide student who intends to temporarily and solely pursue a full course of study rather than pursuing different degrees as a de facto way to prolong their stay in the United States.\" \"DHS believes that it is reasonable for a student to progress to a higher educational level as that is the traditional trajectory in the pursuit of higher education. Restricting these opportunities may reduce the attractiveness of U.S. institutions to top global talent and harm the reputation of American higher education. For STEM OPT, students should be required to file Form I-765 together with Form I-539 and provide proof of paid employment through paystubs: at least 3 months if applying in the first 30 days of the STEM extension window (i.e., 90 days left in OPT), 4 months if applying in the next 30 days (i.e., 60 days left), and 5 months if applying in the final 30 days of OPT. Self-employment should also be permitted during STEM OPT, just as it is in the regular OPT period, so that students who wish to create startups have sufficient time to build their ventures, since the current rules only allow this opportunity during the initial OPT period, which is not sufficient. ICEB-2025-0001, OMB Control Number 1653-0038\n\nThe proposed regulations for the F-1 visa, particularly the reduction of the departure preparation period from 60 to 30 days, may limit students' ability to make adequate arrangements and handle unforeseen circumstances. PLP is putting forth smaller mining plans, possibly removing cyanide from the process for gold, and engaging with community \n\nIf we want to progress to cleaner tech we need minerals. The disposal of mining waste in Bristol Bay would undoubtedly negatively impact the environment, affecting the salmon populations that many Alaskans rely on for food. Additionally, the area represents a significant opportunity for business, as salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone in 2010. Without practical knowledge or relevant training, students will not be able to innovate or create anything new, and working in unauthorized jobs will not benefit either the students or the United States. The new rule would require students to pay more attention to the VISA requirements, especially when they are on the verge of graduating and when the PhD students are at the peak of their research effort cycle. If we want to progress to cleaner fuel we need minerals. Doctoral study often requires flexibility when advisors change, research directions shift, or funding becomes uncertain.

The impact of damaging the Bristol Bay watershed and ecosystem would not only hurt the salmonid and other fish species that live there, but the livelihoods of fisherman and related industries across multiple states. The number of jobs created by a mine would likely be far fewer than the fisheries (and related industries) in Bristol Bay currently support. It does not make sense to alter the Bristol Bay watershed and ecosystem, in terms of jobs or in terms of ecology.

Dear Scott Pruitt and the EPA, As a citizen of the USA, I am vehemently requesting that you disallow the Pebble Mining company access to the wonderful ecosystem of Bristol Bay and its tributaries. Please honor the scientific reports submitted to the EPA in approx 2014 that protect the wonderful ecosystem and its tributaries in the Bristol Bay area. The  2014 proposed determination for a portion of the Bristol Bay watershed  was based on the EPA's own study that found \"the extraction, storage, treatment, and transportation activities associated with building, operating, and maintaining one of the largest mines ever built would pose significant risks to the unparalleled ecosystem that produces one of the greatest wild salmon fisheries left in the world. PS: I'm assuming the 'extension of stay' application will be complicated; if the airport customs just stamp your passport with an stay-end-date when you're returning from visiting your family at Christmas every year, then clearly I'm worrying for nothing and 4 years is more than enough. For PhD candidates in STEM disciplines, it is likely better to make this a 7 year period since STEM PhDs often take 6 years and will provide the student 1 year OPT. For undergraduates, it is reasonable to provide a 5 year period - this would be 4 years of study + 1 year OPT. Stop worshipping the almighty dollar please Scott Pruitt ~ please look beyond your administration blind worship & priority of big corporations getting richer. I simply will not be able to ever pay off these loans if PSLF isn't honored as it was offered when I took these loans years ago as a young person who didn't know any better about government who took things away from people instead of helping them. I see no reason why the PLP should not be allowed to go through \"normal\" channels and be afforded the opportunity to present it's case to the regulators and demonstrate, to the best of it's ability, that it is deserving of a permit. It would be hugely disruptive to both undergrads and PhD students to provide a duration of stay that is shorter than the time it takes for them to complete their education. I therefore strongly suggest you increase the limit to 5 or 6 years, to either match the stay duration with the F-1 visa duration or with the PhD program end date (hence the I-20 duration). (If the PhD graduate stays in the USA for a postdoc or similar, they will need to update their I-20 anyways, so an extension of stay at the same time would again be relatively convenient.) Hi, I understand the concerns surrounding the proposed J-1 timeline, but restricting this will impact research a lot and the progress of the country. We must think of the good of the world and protecting our environment for the good of our future generations, instead of being in cahoots with the big money mining corporations! To do otherwise has the potential to waste scientific effort and investment (in our case precious NIH grant money) as training and many research projects cannot be completed in this time period. They can get a masters from their initial school and continue their PhD at a different school where they will get better research opportunity that benefit the U.S. You can also consider a cap of maximum of 3 school transfer allowed for PhD students to ensure they don't change schools all the time. Hence I believe there should be an option to allow graduate student specifically in the PhD program to change schools since not every schools have necessary equipments to train graduate students. I urge DHS to revise the rule by making exceptions for programs in national interest fields like supply chain management, logistics technology, and operations research. Domestic students appear to have more flexibility to pursue multiple bachelor's or master's degrees, while this option may be more limited for international students. The proposed four-year time period of admission is too short -- many students need more than four years to complete their studies, even with good progress. Now DHS is proposing to eliminate second master’s degrees, even though some of my best hires came through exactly that pathway. Expand Qualifying Employment Definitions: Broaden the scope of eligible public service roles to encompass a wider range of professions that contribute to the public good. The PSLF program is vital for attracting and retaining dedicated professionals in essential public service roles, including education, healthcare, and public safety. While I understand the motivation behind this restriction, it could unintentionally limit opportunities for professionals who wish to pursue an MBA later in their careers as a path toward management roles. For example, one of my analysts first studied business abroad, then came here for a master’s in data science, and later pursued a second master’s in supply chain. If I understand correctly, the new proposal would prevent F-1 students from pursuing another master’s degree if they have already completed one. For example, some pursue an MBA after an engineering degree, or specialize in a field like AI after completing a computer science degree. I feel that at this time allowing a mine in the Bristol Bay area is too much of a risk even if the mine tries it's best to contain toxins and only work in a small section of the bay. I don't feel like anyone should have to live in fear just for wanting an opportunity to have a better life for themselves and their family. This may build better relations with Canadian companies and turn a \"small\" profit, but it is not a long-term investment. Bristol Bay supports the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world and I believe the bay is too fragile to tolerate the risk of large scale mining operation. Bristol Bay supports the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world and I believe the bay is too fragile to tolerate the risk of large scale mining operation. I do not support any private commercial operation that is a potential risk to this fishery. Living in Washington State, I see the results of destruction to salmon habitat through careless logging and reduction of habitat. Living in Washington State, I see the results of destruction to salmon habitat through careless logging and reduction of habitat. We are now paying the price with continued declines in salmon and steelhead populations. First, the Proposal states that students should \"progress to a higher educational level as that is the traditional trajectory in the pursuit of higher education.\" PLP is putting forth smaller mining plans, possibly removing cyanide from the process for gold, and engaging with community \n\nIf we want to progress to cleaner tech we need minerals. Limiting the days prior to finding a position will deter qualified foreign individuals from pursuing a degree in the states, NEGATIVELY impacting higher education income and economy. The long-term risks of the mine far exceed any potential short-term benefits. The long-term risks of the mine far exceed any potential short-term benefits. However, because the MBA is classified as a master’s degree -- at the same level as other master’s degrees and technically lower than a PhD -- the Proposal would prohibit individuals with prior graduate degrees from pursuing an MBA.\nMoreover, it is very common that students with one Master's/PhD degree want to switch their focus of study and get another degree at a lower/the same level. For example, many PhDs continue to study in medical schools to earn an MD degree and vice versa; a lot of Master's/PhD student also apply for business schools to earn an MBA degree after they graduate. I urge the EPA to do the right thing, and NOT withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination which it made based on the Clean Water Act in 2014. It is more cost efficient for the salmon industry to hire foreigners than it is to establish sustainable fair wages and maintain legally standard working conditions for their own Alaskan community. In fact it is amongst the highest profit making industries, however it is not an industry that pays fair wages nor does it provide sustainable gainful employment for the community. Additionally the NEPA document is required to include an in-depth discussion of cumulative and foreseeable future (overlay similar mine development in the same area and environmental setting) impacts of all proposed activities and alternatives (port, power, roads and all support/ancillary facilities and related activities) including waterways, wetlands and fishery habitat among others. This NEPA document is required to assess all related and connected activities, not just the USACE action. I respectfully urge the DHS to reconsider the proposed change of prohibiting international students to pursue programs of same/ lower education level. The 4-year default timeline makes some sense in the context of international students who are coming to study for an undergraduate degree, as the typical timeline of an undergraduate degree is 4 years. PhDs) makes it hard for students to pursue the education needed to better serve the community with both professional knowledge and rigorous academic and research skills. To reduce administrative burdens and reduce costs of implementation of this rule change, it would make sense to have distinct time limitations for students completing their undergraduate degrees versus advanced degrees. While a stated goal of the policy is to reduce uncertainty, a complex EOS procedure may have the opposite effect, significantly increasing the bureaucratic burden and costs for students, schools, and government agencies alike. But if this policy goes into effect, it will dramatically reduce the number of international students choosing to study in the U.S. If this policy is enacted, it will create an environment where international students are forced to leave the U.S. before they can make a real impact in the cybersecurity industry. The U.S. risks falling behind in the cybersecurity arms race if this policy goes through. I write in strong opposition to proposed rule ICEB-2025-0001-0001, which would change the duration of visas for international students from the full course of study needed to receive a degree to only four years. If these restrictive rules are implemented, many talented students will likely choose Canada, the U.K., or other more welcoming countries instead of the U.S., which will undoubtedly weaken America’s leadership in higher education and scientific research. Polish and formal version:\n\nIn my capacity as a researcher within STEM graduate programs, I contend that international students do not, as a rule, displace American citizens. Existing immigration laws have shown themselves to be incompatible with a world where it is in the financial interests of universities and employers to maximize foreign enrollment and employment against the interests of Americans, where diploma mills and visa scams are increasingly commonplace, where the FBI is said to open a new China-related counterintelligence case approximately every 10 hours, and where global air travel is increasingly affordable and anyone anywhere in the world can access detailed guides to taking advantage of our university system and immigration policies. This is in relation to Regulations.gov Document - CDC-2025-0454-0001 (+)\n\nI’m not in the medical field and I do not have specific research to reference, but, I am absolutely certain that the only way for this country to become healthier is to allow for parents to choose which vaccines they want their children to have by consulting with their doctor doing their own research, that is now more readily available than ever before. The best interests of the United States will be met by retaining the current policy, that a visa is good for the full course of study needed to receive a degree. In that document the EPA has stated:  \"After evaluating available information, EPA Region 10 has reason to believe that unacceptable adverse effects on fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas) could result from the discharge of dredge or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit. Further, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of EPA Region 10 that no unacceptable adverse effect(s) will occur.\" I work as a doctor and this has been going on in the medical field in the past 10-15 years as they relax J-1 and HB visa rules. However, if the U.S. replaces Duration of Status with a fixed time limit, it risks losing the very people who are advancing these technologies. Changing to a fixed time period would introduce unnecessary stress, limit flexibility, and discourage talented individuals from choosing the U.S. as their destination. However, the fact that my friends and loved ones can get vaccinated has made it possible for me to see them in person safely and even to attend outdoor events in public. Social distancing in 2020 and 2021 was difficult, but it's been harder in the years since to see all my loved ones and friends return to normal when I cannot safely be in public. Limiting access to the covid vaccine will mean that I am once again unable to see my community or attend something as simple as in-person book club. To ensure that international students are able to complete their studies, it is essential to allow visa extensions within the United States in accordance with the I-20 period. I therefore recommend extending the fixed period to at least 6 years, allowing students sufficient time to complete their studies before departing. If students are unable to complete their academic programs within the I-20 timeframe, the attractiveness of studying in the U.S. will diminish, the enrollment of international students will continue to decline, and the nation’s ability to attract top global talent will be further constrained. Furthermore, if you truly stand done freedom of choice, know that the CDC recommendations can limit availability and the ability of thousands of people to even be able to choose to vaccinate their children, due to factors like vaccine availability and coverage by insurance companies. I believe the head of the Environmental Protection Agency should actually protect the environment, not kowtow to corporations that want to exploit our natural resources for a profit. Maintain the current AAP vaccine guidelines and keep our children safe. There are tens of thousands of premature babies that are alive today because of the advances in neonatal care. There are tens of thousands of people with genetic disease that would not be alive today if it were not for advances in diagnoses and treatment. U.S. universities such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill rely heavily on international students to drive cutting-edge research and bring valuable global viewpoints into academic settings. In a nation that is governed by the \"rule of law\", it is imperative that this project be properly evaluated using the legislatively mandated permitting process under NEPA, which will allow \"all\"  impacts of the proposed project, both pro and con, to be fully vetted. However, to preemptively deny the Pebble Partnership the ability to present the data and analysis they have exhaustively collected violates the due process clause of the Constitution and in my mind is tantamount to a \"taking\". EPA should follow the law and allow the company to go through the permitting process. Restore the access to COVID vaccines for our healthcare workers who are at heightened risk of exposure. Restore the access to COVID vaccines for our children. Please restore the old vaccine guidelines for Covid-19 and rebuke Secretary Kennedy for his continued attacks on vaccines. I agree with the EPA's finding that mining activity in the Bristol Bay watershed poses\nunacceptable risks to the Bristol Bay salmon fishery. I agree with the EPA's finding that mining activity in the Bristol Bay watershed poses unacceptable risks to the Bristol Bay salmon fishery. It is not in the country's best interest to provide a Canadian mining operation the means with which to destroy Bristol Bay and the fishery and related jobs that exist because of it. Please move forward with a Final Determination on the proposed Pebble Mine under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act without delay. Please move forward with a Final\nDetermination on the proposed Pebble Mine under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act\nwithout delay. The negative overall environmental impact of withdrawing clean water act article's which protect the proposed pebble mine site (Bristol Bay) far outweighs the meager economic draw a mine would bring to this area. We can mine for a few years creating some jobs, or we can harvest salmon, a renewable resource, forever. We can mine for a few years creating some jobs, or we can harvest salmon, a renewable resource, forever. The Trump-Vance Administration's proposal would discourage the best international talent from coming to the U.S. and make it harder for current students to stay and contribute to this field. There are other places to mine on this planet, but very few left that are pristine habitat for thousands of species. There are other places to mine on this planet, but very few left that are pristine habitat for thousands of species.

Not to mention all the sustainable jobs that will be lost. Not to mention all the sustainable jobs that will be lost.\nAs someone in regular contact with vulnerable family members, and who would like to avoid the risk of long-term health consequences, I'm deeply concerned that Covid vaccines will not be available to everyone this year, and I hope the committee will consider keeping access to vaccines the same as in previous years. If there are too many visa restrictions, more excellent stem doctoral applicants may choose Europe, Australia and China to continue their scientific research, which is not conducive to maintaining the leadership of the United States in the field of science and technology. Uncertainty and stringent scrutiny could discourage international students from pursuing high-risk, high-reward long-term basic research or sensitive yet critical areas (e.g., AI safety, infectious disease origins). Please ensure the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program remains in effect for the many persons who have made educational and vocational decisions based on its existence. Without the current income based repayment plans, it would be very difficult to provide for my family while providing for children of very low socioeconomic backgrounds. Good teachers can be attracted and retained by economically challenged school districts if this program remains in effect. I would like the pause to continue while the repayment plans are reconsidered and the people are given time to rebudget their lives  to be able to make these payments. As a physician, I have entered a lower paying specialty and chose to work with veterans despite a high loan burden and lower pay, knowing the option of pslf was written into the mpn when taking out loans. The shift to a fixed admission period may reduce flexibility for students and exchange visitors, potentially complicating extensions and re-entry processes, and could hinder the practical management of individual program needs. Regarding pslf:  many of us have made career decisions to serve the public, and have taken lower paying jobs factoring in the existence of pslf. They are crucial to keeping the world population of Sockeye Salmon alive and viable. It is the EPA's job to protect places that provide the United State's citizens with jobs, food, and eco systems. The intrinsic value of Bristol Bay salmon is too great to bring about such a gargantuan mining operation. The Bristol Bay area represents one of the last strongholds of pacific salmon. I do not approve of the proposal to reverse Obama-era protections for Bristol Bay. I urge the administration to consider additional limits on foreign students and exchange visitors (such as ending their ability to work and take jobs from Americans), and to improve tracking of them while they're in the United States.

I urge the administration to consider additional limits on foreign students and exchange visitors (such as ending their ability to work and take jobs from Americans), and to improve tracking of them while they're in the United States. I am opposed to the Pebble Mine as I fear unintended accidents or errors in the mining process could seriously endanger the salmon fishery (and the entire ecosystem) in Bristol Bay. Please do not remove the restrictions - we need environmental regulations to protect our environment so it is healthy far into the future. I urge you to protect not only this environment but also the surrounding community and the jobs reliant on a healthy bay. I think you may consider 4 years for a undergraduate degree, 2 for a master's degree, and 5 for a Ph.D. Also, international graduate students not allowed to switch programs, majors or degree levels is too strict. Graduate education programs often do not have a fixed length, but are dependent on the nature of the field of study and research conducted. As a person and a voter, I urge the EPA to reject this proposal on behalf of the American people and all those individuals dependent on Pebble Beach for the health and welfare. Limiting the duration of F or J visas to 4 years (or any arbitrary number of years) will be extremely deleterious to conducting biomedical research in the United States. Across the United States, it almost always takes more than 4 years to complete a PhD -- sometimes as long as 6 years (even 7 years in exceptional circumstances). The average time to degree for many PhD programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) exceeds 4 years. The area of subject holds a bequest value to me as being pristine and a healthy salmon producing watershed. I think the Pebble permitting process needs to be evaluated based on the engineering merits of the design and industry standards. However, I strongly oppose mining activities at the Pebble Deposit Area. The proposed restrictions (e.g., banning graduate program changes, limiting transfers) represent government overreach into academic decision-making and erode institutional autonomy. Borrowers several years into their career and PSLF payoff plan have coordinated their long-term finances around the current system, whereas newer and new borrowers will have greater flexibility to tailor decision-making to the new reality. The proposed changes to federal student loan and aid policies will drastically worsen this critical shortage. As an international student, I do agree on some of the changes that are proposed but i think if an International student applies for OPT or stem OPT extension, that should automatically extend the stay or the I-94 departure date of the student to how long the OPT is. Covid vaccines have proven safe and effective, and covid infection rates remain high enough that administering vaccines to the general population is warranted. My only suggestion is to allow an exception for students who are applying for OPT or stem OPT, as that in itself is an extension of stay. But also, even if they weren't that effective and infection rates were not high, what business does government have to say that someone can't get a real vaccine for a real disease? If we want our college graduate rates to go, maybe we should leave financial aid alone and let the school be affordable because some people can’t afford it with out financial aid I don’t understand why the government think it’s okay to make financial aid hard to obtain now. Fixed time limits make NO SENSE because the program requirements vary dramatically by field. It seems unbelievable that certain visas including student visas don’t have fixed time limits. Keeping people well using proven methods like vaccines help keep us healthier and out of hospital or worse. Please don't change the current EPA regulations for Bristol Bay. An industrial-scale mine and attendant infrastructure could potentially damage some of the best spawning and rearing habitat in Bristol bay and negatively impact a renewable resource (salmon) beyond repar. Universities, not DHS, are best positioned to determine student progress, program changes, or transfers. Later his interest changed to stem degree so he is doing BAS in data management and analysis.

The proposed rule precludes students from seeking higher education--after a 4-year Bachelors, some students may want to seek Master's degrees or doctorates which can easily take a minimum of 2 more years. 6 years is a better target for Undergraduate students while graduate students in a doctoral program will likely need 8-10 years to complete. It’s better to keep OPT grace period as 60 days since it is hard for students to find a full time job right now which makes 30 day’s grace period too short. It is a matter of public health to allow as many people as interested to protect themselves from this virus, the same way flu shots are widely available to the community. To deny or discourage most individuals  from getting vaccinations is bad science and irresponsible.We don't get herd immunity from cows, or the flu. I have the right to protect myself from disease, and the government has no business deciding otherwise, especially when I've been getting Covid boosters for YEARS.

Key points include:\n\n1. **International Student Visa Policies**: Some commenters suggest that international students should be treated as having a fixed duration of status, while others argue that the current \"duration of status\" model should be preserved to avoid creating uncertainty. There are also concerns about the potential economic impact of limiting international students' stay in the US.\n2. **COVID-19 Vaccine Guidelines**: Commenters have differing opinions on the COVID-19 vaccine, with some advocating for Novavax to be the default vaccine due to its traditional protein technology, while others suggest that the vaccine should be treated like the flu vaccine, with annual updates and widespread availability.\n3. **Environmental Regulations**: Commenters express concerns about the potential environmental impact of mining activities in Alaska, particularly in the Bristol Bay area, and argue that existing restrictions should be maintained to protect the ecosystem.\n4. **Education and Economy**: Some commenters believe that international students are a valuable asset to the US economy, while others argue that American graduates should be prioritized, especially in light of automation and job market changes.\n5. **Permitting Process**: Commenters also discuss the importance of allowing the normal permitting process to proceed, without undue influence from special interest groups, to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information and a thorough evaluation of the facts.\n\n**Attachments and Additional Comments**: Several commenters have attached documents or referred to separate comments submitted on specific topics, including proposed changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, comments from educational institutions, and remarks on financial responsibility composite scores."

         "As an infectious diseases health care professional, I am writing to provide comments ahead of the September 2025 meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). It is critical that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information, and I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed given the recent loss of expert leaders (including the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases), the upheaval in ACIP membership, the lack of sufficient experts currently on ACIP and the significant disruption in  ACIP's regular scientific processes. If the September meeting proceeds, I urge the following recommendations on planned agenda items: \n\nCOVID-19:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines remain our best tool to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. We must restore ACIP's ability to make recommendations based on high-quality, objective data collected and analyzed by CDC scientists and not influenced by political appointees.

CDC scientists presented data at the June ACIP meeting that demonstrate a high number of children under 2 without comorbidities have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — on par with rates for adults ages 50-74. If ACIP recommendations align with FDA's decision, it will dangerously limit vaccine access, removing millions of Americans' choice to be protected. Hepatitis B:\n\nAt the June ACIP meeting, Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD, questioned the utility of the longstanding ACIP recommendation for all infants born in the United States to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. Half of these infections were the result of mother-to-child transmission during birth. MMRV:\n\nVaccines for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella have been extraordinarily successful in preventing these infections and the associated serious illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. This year's measles outbreak in the southwest U.S. has demonstrated that the erosion of measles vaccination rates leads to more measles infections, serious illnesses, hospitalizations and even deaths. Mumps can spread quickly within congregate settings like college campuses. RSV:\n\nI strongly object to the inclusion on the September meeting agenda of items that ACIP has already approved, namely the recommendation to administer monoclonal antibody products to infants to protect them from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of hospitalization in children under 2 years of age. Monoclonal antibody products against RSV have been found to be effective at preventing hospitalizations of infants when their mothers have not been vaccinated against RSV during pregnancy.",

It is critical that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information, and I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed given the recent loss of expert leaders (including the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases), the upheaval in ACIP membership, the lack of sufficient experts currently on ACIP and the significant disruption in  ACIP's regular scientific processes.

As a pediatric infectious diseases physician, I am writing to provide comments ahead of the September 2025 meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). RSV:\n\nI strongly object to the inclusion on the September meeting agenda of items that ACIP has already approved, namely the recommendation to administer monoclonal antibody products to infants to protect them from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of hospitalization in children under 2 years of age.

Hepatitis B:\n\nAt the June ACIP meeting, Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD, questioned the utility of the longstanding ACIP recommendation for all infants born in the United States to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. CDC scientists presented data at the June ACIP meeting that demonstrate a high number of children under 2 without comorbidities have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — on par with rates for adults ages 50-74.

It is critical that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information, and I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed given the recent loss of expert leaders (including the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases), the upheaval in ACIP membership, the lack of sufficient experts currently on ACIP and the significant disruption in  ACIP's regular scientific processes.

Hepatitis B:\n\nAt the June ACIP meeting, Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD, questioned the utility of the longstanding ACIP recommendation for all infants born in the United States to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. CDC scientists presented data at the June ACIP meeting that demonstrate a high number of children under 2 without comorbidities have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — on par with rates for adults ages 50-74.

Targeted vaccination has been shown time and again to be ineffective in preventing the spread of this life-threatening disease.

It is critical that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information, and I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed given the recent loss of expert leaders (including the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases), the upheaval in ACIP membership, the lack of sufficient experts currently on ACIP and the significant disruption in  ACIP's regular scientific processes.

Hepatitis B:\n\nAt the June ACIP meeting, Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD, questioned the utility of the longstanding ACIP recommendation for all infants born in the United States to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. CDC scientists presented data at the June ACIP meeting that demonstrate a high number of children under 2 without comorbidities have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — on par with rates for adults ages 50-74.

It is critical that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information, and I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed given the recent loss of expert leaders (including the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases), the upheaval in ACIP membership, the lack of sufficient experts currently on ACIP and the significant disruption in  ACIP's regular scientific processes.

The following key points are emphasized:\n\n1. **Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)**: I strongly object to the inclusion of items on the September meeting agenda that ACIP has already approved, specifically the recommendation to administer monoclonal antibody products to infants to protect them from RSV, the leading cause of hospitalization in children under 2 years of age.\n\n2. **Hepatitis B**: At the June ACIP meeting, the utility of the longstanding ACIP recommendation for all infants born in the United States to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth was questioned by Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD.\n\n3. **COVID-19**: COVID-19 vaccines remain the best tool to prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19. The scientific evidence strongly supports broad vaccination beyond the limited populations outlined in the FDA's new label. Targeted vaccination has been shown to be ineffective in preventing the spread of this life-threatening disease.\n\n4. **Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (MMRV)**: Vaccines for these diseases have been extraordinarily successful in preventing infections and associated serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. ACIP recommendations should continue to affirm that either MMR+V or MMRV are acceptable options to prevent these infections and their post-infectious complications.\n\n5. **Postponement of the ACIP Meeting**: Given the recent loss of expert leaders, upheaval in ACIP membership, lack of sufficient experts, and significant disruption in ACIP's regular scientific processes, I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed. It is critical that the CDC and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information.\n\nThese comments are provided to ensure that the ACIP meeting is informed by the latest scientific evidence and expert opinion, and that the committee's recommendations continue to prioritize the health and well-being of the population.\nIt is critical that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information, and I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed given the recent loss of expert leaders (including the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases), the upheaval in ACIP membership, the lack of sufficient experts currently on ACIP and the significant disruption in  ACIP's regular scientific processes.

Hepatitis B:\n\nAt the June ACIP meeting, Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD, questioned the utility of the longstanding ACIP recommendation for all infants born in the United States to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. CDC scientists presented data at the June ACIP meeting that demonstrate a high number of children under 2 without comorbidities have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — on par with rates for adults ages 50-74. CDC scientists presented data at the June ACIP meeting that demonstrate a high number of children under 2 without comorbidities have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — on par with rates for adults ages 50-74. If the September meeting proceeds, I urge the following recommendations on planned agenda items: \n\nCOVID-19:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines remain our best tool to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. The scientific evidence continues to strongly support broad vaccination far beyond the limited populations outlined in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) new label.

Targeted vaccination has been shown time and again to be ineffective in preventing the spread of this life-threatening disease.

MMRV:\n\nVaccines for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella have been extraordinarily successful in preventing these infections and the associated serious illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. It is critical that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP once again serve as a source of credible, evidence-based information, and I strongly urge that the ACIP meeting be postponed given the recent loss of expert leaders (including the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases), the upheaval in ACIP membership, the lack of sufficient experts currently on ACIP and the significant disruption in  ACIP's regular scientific processes.

Hepatitis B:\n\nAt the June ACIP meeting, Chair Martin Kulldorff, PhD, questioned the utility of the longstanding ACIP recommendation for all infants born in the United States to receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. CDC scientists presented data at the June ACIP meeting that demonstrate a high number of children under 2 without comorbidities have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — on par with rates for adults ages 50-74.

I urge ACIP to maintain the recommendation for birth dose hepatitis B vaccine. The promise of loan forgiveness is not a reward—it’s a practical necessity that allows individuals to make long-term commitments to fields that the country relies on, such as teaching, healthcare, social work, and public safety. When workers stay in these roles long-term, they build trust with the people they serve, gain specialized knowledge, and provide stability that is essential for effective public service. They educate our children, provide healthcare to underserved populations, protect public safety, and maintain infrastructure. Without it, more professionals would be forced to leave public service in search of higher-paying private sector jobs just to manage their student loan debt, leaving critical gaps in care and coverage.\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness should not be changed because it plays a critical role in sustaining the public sector and delivering essential services to communities across the country. Those who pursue public service careers often do so out of a commitment to helping others, knowing full well that these roles offer significantly lower pay compared to private sector jobs.

Over the past 12 years, my company has collaborated with international students and scholars from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Edgewood College, and other local institutions. To Whom It May Concern,\n\nAs a small business owner based in Madison, Wisconsin, I write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule under DHS Docket No. The University of Wisconsin-Madison alone hosts thousands of international students and scholars. As a small business owner, a parent, and a proud resident of Madison, I believe we must continue to welcome those who seek knowledge, share culture, and contribute to our shared future. These individuals not only contribute to research and education but also support local businesses, rent apartments, dine at restaurants, and engage in community activities. For businesses, the ripple effects include reduced access to skilled interns, delays in hiring, and complications in project planning. The D/S policy has enabled seamless collaboration, allowing students and scholars to focus on their academic and professional pursuits without the constant anxiety of visa expiration. In my experience, one of our best interns in computer science student from China, was able to extend his stay and complete a critical project thanks to the D/S policy. 2025-0250-0001, which seeks to eliminate the Duration of Status (D/S) policy for F, J, and I visa holders. As an infectious disease physician working in nonprofit healthcare, I submit this letter to strongly urge the Department of Education to preserve and strengthen the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and to support effective implementation through adequate staffing and funding for Federal Student Aid. I strongly urge ACIP to uphold the birth-dose recommendation, which remains one of our most effective preventive tools. Both maternal RSV vaccination and infant monoclonal antibody products are safe and effective in preventing hospitalizations in young children. Continue streamlining the PSLF program to improve accessibility and trust for borrowers in public service\n\nThank you for your consideration and for continuing to invest in a healthier America, one that values education, supports those who serve, and ensures that opportunity remains accessible to all. PSLF and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans represent essential commitments by the federal government to those who commit their lives to public service. It is critically important that IDR plans continue to offer repayment options that consider only the income of the individual borrower. A general hospitalist, for example, typically earns significantly more than an infectious disease physician despite the additional years of subspecialty fellowship and training we undergo. Residency and fellowship represent the most intense, formative, and under-compensated years of a physician’s life. As an infectious disease physician, my service extends far beyond individual patient care. ACIP's decisions directly impact the health of the communities I serve, and it is vital that recommendations remain rooted in strong science and broad access. Given the recent turnover in leadership — including the loss of the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases — and the disruption to ACIP's usual scientific processes, I am deeply concerned about the committee's ability to function at full strength. As a clinician working in infectious diseases, I appreciate the opportunity to provide input ahead of the September 2025 meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine has been critical in reducing disease burden. Mumps spreads easily in group settings, rubella can cause devastating pregnancy outcomes, and varicella carries serious risks including shingles later in life. Adjustments to the definitions of a qualifying\nemployer under Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), changes to income-driven repayment\nplans like Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income Contingent Repayment (ICR), and shifts in\nthe regulation of federal student financial assistance could have serious negative consequences\nfor students like me.

First, narrowing the definition of a qualifying employer for PSLF would reduce the opportunities available to those of us planning to work in public service fields.

The United States must continue to welcome international students, researchers, and journalists in ways that support long-term academic collaboration, cultural exchange, and press freedom. I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed rule that would replace the current “duration of status” framework with fixed admission periods for F, J, and I visa holders. While I recognize the stated goal of increasing oversight, I believe the proposed changes would create serious unintended consequences for students, researchers, and journalists, while undermining the United States’ global competitiveness. While the intent may be to improve oversight, this rigid approach could unintentionally harm higher education institutions, businesses that depend on a global workforce, and communities that benefit from the presence of international students. I respectfully urge DHS to preserve flexibility in F-1 student regulations so that America continues to attract and retain the best global talent. As someone who has closely observed the contributions of international students to U.S. education, research, and the workforce, I strongly urge DHS to reconsider imposing fixed limits. This additional strain on institutional resources risks diverting attention away from education and research, while complicating long-term planning for programs that depend on international participants. Time limits would force capable students to cut short their work, undermining U.S. leadership in research and innovation. Economic Contribution\nInternational students contributed nearly $40 billion to the U.S. economy in tuition and living expenses in recent years, supporting universities, housing markets, and local businesses. Administrative Burdens and Risk of Status Loss\nFrequent extension applications create unnecessary bureaucracy and increase the chance of unintentional violations. Streamline and simplify extension or transfer processes, reducing administrative burdens. Forcing participants to apply for multiple extensions will not only increase costs and uncertainty for individuals, but will also impose a heavy administrative burden on universities and sponsoring organizations. I owe more than $121,000 in student loan debt because of (1) a school that did not award credits that can be transferred, (2) a predatory FFEL lender that directed me to a Joint Consolidation Loan, and (3) having to borrow loans to ensure I could pay for school while working full time, raising two children as a divorced mother, and caring for a parent with Alzheimer's. This new loan is eligible for PSLF, finally, and prior to the threats to PSLF I could expect the payment counts (made for more than 20 years) to be completed on the new consolidation loan in June 2025. There was no mechanism to separate these loans until the bipartisan Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act was finally passed. While our tuition and fees are low, the student loan programs are critical to providing access to higher education and vocational programs.The opportunity costs for low income students, many of whom are working parents are high. I have spent more than 25 years serving student and parents first in a non-profit higher education grant and loan servicing agency, and for the last 22 years at a local community college. It is not only the educational programs that prepare students to move on to the second two years of their bachelors degrees but the vocational training offered at these schools that make us so vital to the country. My experience in financial aid for more than 20 years, and now in student accounts has put me in direct contact with our high-poverty low-income community on a regular basis.\nMy passion for serving low-income, first-generation students has kept me at a public school, earning less money than I would in the private sector. I am writing to share my comments about both the proposed changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and Income-Driven Repayment plans (PAYE & IBR). Every time a rule is changed, my loans are put in administrative forbearance because of litigation involved, costing me MONTHS and even A WHOLE YEAR in which my payments don’t count or are on hold without my doing or any resolution. In order to qualify for PSLF, I have been forced to pay through an IDR plan for years, which means most of the money that I’ve paid (nearly a second mortgage) has been capitalized interest. We want to pay back our loans, but we just want our terms, integrity, and years of progress toward forgiveness to be honored. We just want our loan terms to be honored and would like there to be regulations on the predatory behavior of student loan service lenders. As conversations progress regarding the current educational climate and student loans, please consider the following:\nHonor the years of service and PSLF for borrowers who have been working toward this for years. Remember that student loanst created to be a lifelong burden or to be capitalized on - they were created to make it more affordable for ALL individuals to have an opportunity to go to college. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, along with other Income Based Repayment (IBR) plans are critical to survival for myself and many hard working Americans across the nation. If changes are necessary, I ask of you to make them to support all Americans who sought the American dream of going to college and had not family resources to do so. This program is an amazing pipeline to get Americans into the public service workforce and fall in love with it. I am currently a clinical psychologist working at a public children's hospital with 150K in student loan debt. Working for a public children's hospital allowed me to meet my career goals and make enough funds to where I can survive until my student debt is taken care of. I would not have been able to survive then only making $25K a year having to make full student loan payments. Beyond entrepreneurship, international students are indispensable to the American scientific and research ecosystem, making up a substantial portion of the graduate student population, particularly in critical STEM fields. This approach would attract and retain top talent by providing a defined route to permanent residency for high-achieving international students. According to NAFSA, international students contributed over $43 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2023-2024 academic year and supported nearly 400,000 American jobs. A Look Back: The Lessons of Policy\nThe policies of the late 1990s and early 2000s provide a stark case study in strategic versus reactive decision-making. Establishing clear criteria—academic excellence, strong community ties, and adherence to regulations—would create a system that is both secure and beneficial for America's long-term success. The time has come to make strategic, rather than reactive, policy choices that will secure America's intellectual and economic leadership for generations to come. The decisions we make today on immigration, especially policies for international students, will have profound and lasting consequences on the nation's future. To ensure its continued strength and avoid a future that is less secure and prosperous, the U.S. must adopt policies that attract and retain the world's most capable minds. I navigated gaining as many grants and scholarships as I could covering a good portion of my undergraduate degree; however, I knew I always wanted to be a clinical psychologist helping those with autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. I sincerely hope that the program will continue to support individuals in public service, including those working in nonprofit organizations, as it plays a critical role in enabling us to serve our communities and our country. As you may know, PSLF is a critical initiative that enables dedicated professionals in public service roles—including teachers, nurses, first responders, and government employees—to continue serving our communities without the burden of insurmountable student loan debt. I am writing in regards to propose changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and SAVE program and to express my strong support for its continued existence. Beyond entrepreneurship, international students are indispensable to the American scientific and research ecosystem, making up a substantial portion of the graduate student population, particularly in critical STEM fields. The Economic Engine of Higher Education\nThe financial contributions of international students are a critical pillar for many U.S. universities. Indispensable Contributions to Scientific Research & Innovation\nThe role of foreign-born individuals in shaping America's technological landscape is a historical fact. Non-profit organizations develop and retain skilled labor, offering high-quality services at a lower cost compared to private contractors. If universities, hospitals, and other healthcare providers become ineligible for PSLF, many medical professionals will choose to leave public and non-profit healthcare settings for higher-paying private-sector jobs. STEM doctoral and master's degrees are earned by international students, filling the high-skilled labor pipeline and pushing the boundaries of scientific discovery. In my experience, the value provided by in-house, experienced professionals is far superior to the work done by for-profit health care entities, both in terms of quality and cost-effectiveness. Many physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals rely on PSLF to affordably pursue careers in lower paying non-profit hospitals and community health centers. I believe PSLF serves as a key motivator for individuals to consider health care and non-profit work as viable career options. This approach would attract and retain top talent by providing a defined route to permanent residency for high-achieving international students. In the post-COVID era, the United States continues to face growing workforce shortages in healthcare, particularly in rural and underserved areas where hospitals and other healthcare centers struggle to maintain adequate staffing. The time has come to make strategic, rather than reactive, policy choices that will secure America's intellectual and economic leadership for generations to come. As such, I wish to raise several concerns about the potential repercussions of a mandate that may reduce access to, or otherwise diminish, support for public service professionals via federal aid programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF):\n\nDevaluation of Community-Oriented Work\nLimiting access to critical support programs minimizes the value of those who have worked diligently to serve their communities. I am writing to provide feedback in response to the notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee concerning potential changes to regulations that impact public service loan programs and the broader framework supporting public service professionals. In closing, I strongly urge the committee to ensure that any proposed regulations continue to recognize, preserve, and uplift the contributions of public service professionals. By allowing grace periods, clarifying definitions, and coordinating better with universities, the United States can maintain compliance while continuing to attract and retain the brightest minds from around the world. Clearer and more uniform definitions of “full-time enrollment,” especially for graduate students with assistantships or students approved for reduced course loads, would reduce confusion. Graduate programs in STEM, in particular, rely heavily on international students to support federally funded projects and to push forward discoveries in medicine, technology, and science. As an international student currently studying in the United States on an F-1 visa, I would like to respectfully share my perspective and concerns regarding this proposed regulation. Federal programs that reduce financial barriers to education and career access are not mere benefits—they are investments in the well-being, resilience, and equity of our society. Removing stability from our immigration status directly undermines the ability of universities to carry out their missions and damages the global reputation of U.S. higher education. If termination is automatic, students could lose legal status within days through no fault of their own, forcing them to leave the country abruptly and disrupting research projects, teaching responsibilities, and even grant deliverables that the federal government itself funds. Instead of automatic termination, a grace period could be provided so that students and schools have time to resolve discrepancies. A central concern is the possibility of automatic SEVIS termination for students who are flagged as not full-time. In fact, studies from the American Psychological Association affirm that meaningful work significantly correlates with higher productivity and long-term employee commitment, especially in mission-driven environments like healthcare and education. Continued access to programs like PSLF helps address this imbalance and promotes retention in these critical fields (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). I also come from a low-income background, and federal student loans were my only viable pathway to higher education and a stable, purposeful career. As a doctor of physical therapy and federal student loan borrower, I write to urge the Department of Education to preserve and strengthen income-driven repayment (IDR) plans such as Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), as well as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. When I signed the Master Promissory Note and enrolled in an IDR plan, it was with the understanding, based on federal policy,that if I paid consistently for 20-25 years under an income-driven plan, any remaining balance would be forgiven. If the Department eliminates or undermines the 20- or 25-year forgiveness clause in these repayment plans, the 10 years of payments I’ve already made, many of which barely touched the principal due to interest, will effectively be erased. Without a path to forgiveness, whether through PSLF or long-term IDR completion, I like millions of other professionals will be carrying this debt for life, despite doing everything the system asked of us: completing our education, entering a critical profession, and making every payment as agreed.\nInternational students on F-1 and J-1 visas contribute substantially to the U.S. economy—paying billions in tuition dollars, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs, and generating tax revenues at both state and federal levels. Like many healthcare professionals, I took out significant federal loans to complete my Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree. Our adversaries are not idle: by easing immigration and post-study work rules, countries such as Canada and Australia have made sustained efforts to attract international STEM students and researchers. D/S facilitates stability for F-1 and J-1 students and scholars: it enables planning, robust internships, and long-term contributions, including in high-growth start-ups and research labs. Eliminating D/S greatly increases uncertainty and nonimmigrant visa burdens, making U.S. universities less attractive relative to global competitors like China, Canada, and the UK. Dear Secretary of Homeland Security and Rulemaking Officials,\n\nI write as a concerned American citizen with professional experience in economics and national security policy, to respectfully urge the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw the proposed rule DHS-2025-0250-0001 eliminating the Duration-of-Status (D/S) designation for F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrants. In effect, the proposed rule would strengthen the hand of strategic competitors. Policymakers advancing “Buy American, Hire American” should understand that robust economic nationalism requires preserving channels for world-class talent to contribute—and stay—in the U.S. The United States leads global innovation—especially in STEM fields—thanks in part to its ability to attract, retain, and develop top-tier international talent. This administrative change would undermine U.S. strategic, economic, and innovation advantages—particularly in STEM fields—and ultimately threaten national competitiveness. It runs counter to national imperatives in innovation, economic vitality, and global competitiveness. Many of these institutions participate in Title IV federal student aid programs and serve students who rely on Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, including Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), to make their education affordable. Income-Contingent Repayment Plan--Changes\nFor many of our graduates, particularly those from modest socioeconomic backgrounds or those pursuing careers with lower starting salaries, income-driven repayment plans like PAYE and ICR are essential lifelines. Modifications to income-driven repayment plans such as Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and\n3. Ensure Educational Program Accessibility\nTo address the Department's concern about regulations potentially \"inhibiting innovation and contributing to rising college costs,\" we recommend:\nCreating pathways for specialized healthcare programs like AHM to access Title IV funding without unnecessary administrative burdens\nDeveloping financial aid structures that recognize the unique nature of specialized healthcare education\n\nConclusion\n\nAs acupuncture and herbal medicine gain increased recognition from major healthcare institutions and insurance providers, addressing these financial barriers to education and early career sustainability is essential to meet growing demand. The current ambiguity has prevented many qualified practitioners from accessing loan forgiveness despite providing essential healthcare services in underserved communities, community health centers, and academic institutions. We encourage modifications to PAYE and ICR programs to better accommodate the unique career trajectory of acupuncture and herbal medicine (AHM) professionals, who often:\n-Face high initial education costs ($50,000-90,000)\n-Experience a gradual income build as they obtain certification and licensure and establish their practices\n-Work in mixed employment/self-employment arrangements\n\n3. Preserve and Strengthen Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Eligibility\nWe recommend that the Department explicitly include licensed acupuncturists and herbal medicine practitioners working in integrative healthcare settings within the refined definitions of qualifying employers for PSLF eligibility. Public Service Loan Forgiveness— Qualifying Employer Definitions\nPSLF is a critical tool that enables our graduates to pursue careers in the public and nonprofit sectors without being crushed by student debt. Removing or narrowing definitions of qualifying employment risks cutting off debt relief for vital health professionals who play critical roles in nonprofit community health centers, integrative medical practices, and rural health clinics, directly supporting public health. From an academic advising and student retention standpoint, fear of unaffordable debt also discourages students from pursuing graduate education or entering mission-driven but lower-paying fields. Strong federal regulation ensures that students are protected, aid dollars are well spent, and institutions like ours that uphold academic integrity can continue to thrive. AHMC stands ready to provide input and serve as a resource to ensure that future regulations reflect the realities and needs of complementary and integrative health education. Respectfully submitted,\n\nThe AHM Coalition \n\nKristin Richeimer Executive Director, CCAHM\nOlivia Hsu Friedman, DACM, L.Ac. For further communication, please contact Kristin Richeimer, CAE, Executive Director, CCAHM. Dipl.OM, Chair, ASA\nMina Larson Chief Executive Officer, NCCAOM\nMark McKenzie Executive Director, ACAHM The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule (ICEB-2025-0001), however, would close this path by eliminating duration of status (D/S), imposing fixed visa terms, restricting program changes, shortening grace periods, and prohibiting second degree programs at the same academic level. Blocking a Critical Academic and Career Transition Path\nFor students in fields with limited opportunities, such as the arts, pursuing a second master’s degree in a different discipline is essential. 2.Permit Multiple Master’s Degrees With Limits: Allow students to pursue more than one master’s degree when academically justified, provided the second program is in a different academic discipline or field. I respectfully urge DHS to adopt a balanced approach: preserve duration of status, allow international students to pursue a limited number of graduate degrees in distinct fields, and strengthen compliance mechanisms through oversight rather than rigid restrictions. Recommended Modifications:\n\nTo balance DHS oversight needs with the legitimate academic and career interests of international students, I respectfully recommend the following adjustments:\n1.Preserve Duration of Status (D/S): Maintain D/S as the foundation of F-1 status while introducing mid-program compliance checks to address oversight concerns. For international students, this has long been a legitimate and necessary option: gaining skills in more competitive fields allows us to maintain lawful status while adapting to labor market realities. Public Service Loan Forgiveness— Qualifying Employer Definitions \n\nPSLF is a critical tool that enables our graduates to pursue careers in the public and nonprofit sectors without being crushed by student debt. It also ensures that public servants can afford to continue their work, while making monthly payments on loan forgiveness, in turn strengthening local communities across the nation. We strongly believe the PSLF program strengthens communities, fills critical workforce shortages, and ensures that public service remains an accessible and attainable career path. Income-Contingent Repayment Plan--Changes\n\nFor many of our graduates—particularly those from modest socioeconomic backgrounds or those pursuing careers with lower starting salaries—income-driven repayment plans like PAYE and ICR are essential lifelines. We implore this Committee to not limit access to federal loans for student borrowers, to broaden IDR plans to make them \naffordable and accessible, realizing that the ability to repay student loans on a scale adjusted to one’s income works to ensure continued loan payments with public-sector salaries. She is a single mother living in a rural community who made a courageous choice — instead of relying on public assistance, she took out over $60,000 in student loans to pursue a graduate degree in clinical social work. Conclusion\n\nWhile the proposed rule seeks to strengthen oversight of international students, its current form would harm students, weaken U.S. higher education, and reduce America’s global competitiveness. Strong federal regulation ensures that students are protected, aid dollars are well spent, and institutions like ours that uphold academic integrity can continue to thrive. While each of these changes may be framed as a step toward simplification or fiscal responsibility, I fear they would have profound and damaging consequences for students, alumni, and the broader mission of higher education institutions like ours. My experiences, and those I have heard about from many other student loan borrowers, have led me to understand that the proposed rules and regulations need to provide reasonable options that help make college and meaningful work accessible to all who want it. immediate/priority) processing of buyback requests so that borrowers can complete their loan obligations made in good faith, (4) updates of PSLF payment counts to include the many months that borrowers have been in limbo due to the SAVE plan being contested in the courts; (5) maintaining access to existing IDR plans and/or developing payment plans with equivalent and/or better terms for borrowers that provide reasonable flexibility and affordability and do not increase payment amounts for any borrower, and (6) reforms to existing payment plans to prevent ballooning interest. The rules and regulations should include (1) continuation of the existing PSLF eligibility requirements, with potential expansion to include other areas of public service that have not previously been eligible; (2) payment plans that consider the current cost of living for each geographic region, (3) timely (i.e. I share my story to provide a point of comparison, to tell you what one of the better positions looks like, and to show you how this relatively privileged position could be destroyed overnight if PSLF were no longer available to those of us who choose to serve the public good. I eventually was able to find my way into an appropriate and fulfilling education and career, thanks to having adequate federal student loans available to me, as I would not have been able to continue my education otherwise. Because it took me longer than average to finish my education and find appropriate work, I have been unable to save for retirement until this past year, when I was finally able to secure a highly competitive tenure-track position in the community college system.\nBecause of these relatively low salaries, many mental health counselors also rely on PSLF in order to be able to provide services to communities with limited access and means. Replacing D/S with fixed-term admission would weaken U.S. strategic competitiveness, inflict avoidable economic harm at home, and undermine our ability to capture global talent in priority industries. 2) Economic Harm: Billions at Stake for Campuses and Communities\nInternational students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,175 American jobs in 2023–24, according to NAFSA’s national accounting. 6) Administrative Burden Without Security Gain\nFixed-term admission will force large volumes of I-539 extension filings—adding cost for students and load for USCIS, with filing fees raised in 2024 (I-539 to $420 online / $470 paper) and variable processing timelines. 5) Compliance Reality: D/S Isn’t Lax—It’s Supervised and Low-Risk\nStudents are already tracked in SEVIS and must maintain status through full-time study and authorized training. It lets students remain while maintaining full-time status and during authorized practical training—precisely when they become most valuable contributors to U.S. labs and firms. It is my mission to help my students identify the right career path for them early in their college experience; I do everything I can to help them complete their education as efficiently as possible, and with as little debt as possible. Providing career counseling to college students is now a major part of my role in the community college. I do not meet qualifications to teach in any other role in higher education outside of the type of role I am in now, which is unique in higher education (I am unaware of an equivalent role existing in any other college system in the country).

The promise of forgiveness after 120 qualifying payments has not only helped make loan repayment affordable but has also kept many of us in the public sector when burnout or financial hardship could have forced us out. We are not asking for a free ride—we are asking for the promise to be kept, for stability, and for a fair chance to escape the tunnel of lifelong student debt. Public Service Loan Forgiveness— Qualifying Employer Definitions\nPSLF is a critical tool that enables our graduates to pursue careers in the public and nonprofit sectors without being crushed by student debt. Redefining the criteria for a qualifying employer under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program,\n2. Narrowing the definition of what constitutes a qualifying employer risks disqualifying nonprofit hospitals, community clinics, public school systems, and other vital service organizations.

Modifications to income-driven repayment plans such as Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and\n3. Without PSLF and income-driven repayment (IDR) options, borrowers like myself would face enormous challenges. I urge policymakers to carefully consider the broader consequences of these proposed changes and to uphold federal programs that enable students to pursue meaningful careers without lifelong financial hardship. While each of these changes may be framed as a step toward simplification or fiscal responsibility, I fear they would have profound and damaging consequences for students, alumni, and the broader mission of higher education institutions like ours. From an academic advising and student retention standpoint, fear of unaffordable debt also discourages students from pursuing graduate education or entering mission-driven but lower-paying fields. Reducing the generosity or accessibility of IDR plans would likely increase loan delinquency and default rates, which not only harms individuals but also affects our institution’s eligibility and reputation in federal aid programs. To Whom It May Concern:\n\nAs a faculty member at D’Youville University, I am writing to express my concern regarding proposed or potential changes to key federal student aid and loan forgiveness policies. Efforts to streamline federal student financial assistance regulations in ways that may compromise oversight and accountability. Income-Contingent Repayment Plan--Changes\nFor many of our graduates—particularly those from modest socioeconomic backgrounds or those pursuing careers with lower starting salaries—income-driven repayment plans like PAYE and ICR are essential lifelines.

Reducing the generosity or accessibility of IDR plans would likely increase loan delinquency and default rates, which not only harms individuals but also affects our institution’s eligibility and reputation in federal aid programs. I urge policymakers to carefully consider the broader consequences of these proposed changes and to uphold federal programs that enable students to pursue meaningful careers without lifelong financial hardship. Public Service Loan Forgiveness— Qualifying Employer Definitions\nPSLF is a critical tool that enables our graduates to pursue careers in the public and nonprofit sectors without being crushed by student debt. Public Service Loan Forgiveness— Qualifying Employer Definitions\nPSLF is a critical tool that enables our graduates to pursue careers in the public and nonprofit sectors without being crushed by student debt. Narrowing the definition of what constitutes a qualifying employer risks disqualifying nonprofit hospitals, community clinics, public school systems, and other vital service organizations.

While each of these changes may be framed as a step toward simplification or fiscal responsibility, I fear they would have profound and damaging consequences for students, alumni, and the broader mission of higher education institutions like ours. Streamlining Financial Aid Regulations\nWhile we support thoughtful reform that reduces administrative burden, we are wary of \"streamlining\" efforts that might weaken consumer protections or transparency.

Subject: Public Comment on Negotiated Rulemaking for Title IV Programs (Docket ID: ED-2025-OPE-0016)\n\nTo the U.S. Department of Education:\n\nI am writing to provide input regarding the planned negotiated rulemaking process concerning programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, specifically Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans like PAYE and ICR. For families like mine, federal student loan programs are not abstract policies; they are essential lifelines that factor heavily into our financial planning and our ability to sustain a life in military service. The promise of PSLF was, and continues to be, a significant factor in our family's long-term financial planning, helping to make the sacrifices inherent in military service more manageable. Maintaining the current policies ensures that these individuals can continue contributing, while adding unnecessary restrictions or extra layers of review would not meaningfully improve security or oversight, and could instead discourage or prevent these highly skilled international professionals from staying and contributing in the United States. In other words, such extra restrictions would not significantly enhance national security or policy oversight, but they would create additional hurdles that could deter highly skilled international students from remaining in the U.S.\n\n【Why proposed changes would harm】\n\n1. Introducing additional layers of review or stricter limitations would largely duplicate existing checks, create unnecessary administrative burdens, slow down employment and academic processes, and in many cases, actively harm students’ ability to continue contributing productively to the U.S. workforce. Many international employees follow the F-1 → OPT → H-1B → Green Card path, and the ability to pursue a second master’s is a crucial buffer that ensures continuity for both the employee and the employer. The Duration of Status (D/S) framework and the ability to pursue more than one master’s degree are essential for maintaining both the legality of my stay and the stability of my employment. My employer fully supports H-1B sponsorship, and I hope to continue contributing to my company in the long term, provided that current policies remain in place. Critical Role of Income-Driven Repayment (IDR): IDR plans are absolutely crucial for managing my student loan obligations. Any changes to IDR plans must prioritize affordability and genuine ease of use for borrowers. Please, strengthen and enhance the accessibility, affordability, and reliability of IDR plans and PSLF. I urge the Department, throughout the negotiated rulemaking process, to prioritize the needs of borrowers like me.\nHere is a polished version of the summary:\n\n**Simplification of Annual Recertification Process**\n\nThe current annual recertification process poses unnecessary challenges, resulting in bureaucratic hurdles that can lead to payment shocks and interest capitalization. This can be particularly destabilizing for families who already face frequent relocation and uncertainty. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended that the recertification process be streamlined to reduce administrative burdens.\n\n**Supporting International Students' Employment Opportunities**\n\nDespite the existing challenges, the current system enables high-achieving and hardworking international graduates to secure employment and make significant contributions to the US economy. However, it is acknowledged that international students face greater difficulties in securing employment compared to their US citizen counterparts. A more efficient recertification process would help to support the success of these capable individuals and promote their meaningful contributions to the US economy."

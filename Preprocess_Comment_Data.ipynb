         "Each year on July 28, we come together to recognize World Hepatitis Day, a global moment to raise awareness, celebrate progress, and renew our commitment to eliminating viral hepatitis. At NASTAD, we are proud to work alongside advocates, policymakers, and public health leaders to advance  equitable access for solutions to the hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV.)  \n\nThis year marks a major policy milestone in the United States: the Cure Hepatitis C Act of 2025,  a bipartisan effort introduced by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). The Cure Hepatitis C Act of 2025 offers a comprehensive strategy that includes expanding hepatitis C access to testing and treatment, strengthening public health infrastructure at the state and local levels, and implementing a cost-saving subscription model to purchase hepatitis C medications through registered pharmacies, correctional systems, and the Indian Health Services. The legislation  empowers community health centers, opioid treatment programs, and correctional facilities to integrate hepatitis C services and advance hepatitis B prevention and treatment efforts, including support for point-of-care testing and linkage to care. NASTAD played a key role in supporting the development of this legislation and continues to advocate for its passage to help ensure everyone with HCV has access to timely, life-saving care. \n\nReaffirming the Importance of the Hepatitis B Birth Dose \n\nAs we highlight our progress, it’s also crucial to reinforce the need to protect evidence-based prevention efforts, particularly the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine.  Recognized as one of the first anti-cancer vaccines, the HBV vaccine is part of the national immunization schedules in 190 countries, including the United States. However, the hepatitis B birth dose specifically is only included in 113 countries. Studies show that administering the first dose within 24 hours of birth, followed by at least two subsequent doses, is 90% effective in preventing perinatal transmission. The introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine in the childhood vaccination schedule in 1991 in the United States has been the primary driver of the substantial decrease in prevalence of hepatitis B among persons 6–19 years of age. Despite decades of safety data and the successful reduction of childhood hepatitis B in the U.S., the universal hepatitis B birth dose recommendation is under threat. Global research has shown that even in regions where public health infrastructure is burdened by substantial health system barriers such as sub-Saharan Africa1,2,3, southeast Asia, and western Pacific countries, the HBV birth dose vaccine significantly reduced the risk of vertical transmission. Reversing course and implementing a targeted hepatitis B vaccination program has beendemonstrated to be ineffective in countries such as Greenland, Brazil, and Angola. Inclusively, this approach  was shown to complicate guidelines and requires substantial efforts for selecting infants at risk in addition to stigmatizing pregnant people. Additionally, HBV prevention strategies that include interventions to prevent perinatal transmission are considered very cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6957 per quality-of-life-adjusted life year saved.  In the United States, jurisdictions such as Hawaii have decades of experience demonstrating the life impact of the hepatitis B birth dose. In 1992, Hawaii implemented routine infant hepatitis B vaccination and according to Perz, et al. the last reported case in a child aged <15 years in Hawaii occurred in 1996. Additionally, the hepatitis B vaccination prevents hepatitis D, a virus that requires the hepatitis B virus for its replication. Globally, hepatitis D affects  nearly 5% (an estimated 12 million) of people who have chronic HBV. On July 27, 2025, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified hepatitis D as carcinogenic to humans. According to Dr. Meg Doherty, incoming Director of Science for Health at the World Health Organization, “this reclassification marks a critical step in global efforts to raise awareness, improve screening, and expand access to new treatments for hepatitis D.”  \n\nLooking Ahead  \n\nWorld Hepatitis Day is a time to reflect, but more importantly,  to act. With the Cure Hepatitis C Act of 2025 and renewed attention to hepatitis B prevention such as immunization, let’s  build on this momentum with evidence-based policies, person-centered care and community-led action. As Dr. Michelle D. Fiscus, MD, FAAP, pediatrician and Chief Medical Officer from the Association of Immunization Managers states  “The recommendation to provide hepatitis B vaccination to every baby not only significantly reduces the chance of a baby contracting hepatitis B from a mom who may not have been tested or know she's infected, but also gives us a chance to eliminate hepatitis B disease in the U.S completely.” "

         "The ACIP must uphold evidence-based immunization policies grounded in rigorous science to protect public health. Recent changes, including the replacement of 17 expert members with individuals lacking vaccinology expertise and ties to anti-vaccine advocacy, risk undermining this mission. The committee’s position on immunizations should prioritize peer-reviewed data, transparency, and expertise to ensure safe, effective vaccine recommendations.\n\nACIP should reaffirm its commitment to established vaccines like hepatitis B, MMRV, and COVID-19, which have proven safety and efficacy in preventing severe outcomes. For example, data from 2025 shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce hospitalization in children and pregnant women, yet unilateral removals of these recommendations threaten access. With measles cases surging (1,300+ in 2025), ACIP should maintain robust childhood immunization schedules and Vaccines for Children program eligibility to prevent outbreaks and ensure affordability.\n\nThe committee should reject non-evidence-based claims, such as thimerosal’s alleged harms, debunked by decades of research. Its position must align with GRADE analyses and input from medical societies like the AMA and IDSA, excluded from recent deliberations. Restoring open work groups and expert-led processes is critical to counter the \"irresponsible and dangerous\" shift critics, including former CDC directors, have warned against.\n\nACIP’s recommendations shape insurance coverage and public trust. A science-driven stance will prevent confusion, reduce costs, and protect vulnerable populations. I urge the committee to postpone the September 2025 meeting, reinstate qualified experts, and ensure all immunization policies reflect rigorous, transparent science to safeguard lives."

It also triggers similar conditions in adults and then some. By limiting Covid-19 vaccines to elderly and immunocompromised, you defeat the purpose of what we community immunity which these people rely upon. By limiting access to these vaccines, you endanger medical providers and you render immunoglobulin replacement therapies useless. Furthermore, if rumors are true that you’re considering banning these vaccines, you drive up costs for healthcare because immunocompromised will be forced to get prescriptions for PEMGARDA. Which is substantially more expensive than covid vaccines. At a time when hospitals are already reporting being full, restricting access to COVID vaccines is stupid. \n\nHepatitis B vaccine - this one is newer to me so I’m not sure I had it. But if you can prevent the development of liver cancer, why would you not do that? \n\nAh, yes, the MMR/MMR-V. Are you ready for the reality? These vaccines still don’t cause autism. However, rubella babies like myself have a higher incidence rate of autism. And measles is definitely not desirable nor is chickenpox. These conditions can cause lifelong issues such as the hearing loss for which I am finally going to get hearing aids. Thanks Kennedy for leading to my contracting measles! Autistics like me will never forgive Kennedy. \n\nThe RSV vaccine will help babies annd immunocompromised not have asthma or asthma exacerbations later. RSV is no fun.

He has undermined expertise, the scientific method, and a legitimacy of our public health infrastructure. I noticed that the hepatitis B, Covid, RSV and MMR vaccinations are up for discussion at this meeting. I don’t even understand why hepatitis B and MMR are being discussed. These are well established vaccines that have prevented thousands and thousands of deaths and have a great safety profile. Anything to restrict access to these vaccines will cause harm to the health of our nation, particularly children. We have just experienced the largest measles outbreak in over 30 years. It was made worse by the lies promulgated by RFK Junior. Likewise, the attacks on the safety and efficacy of the Covid vaccine and mRNA technology in general are unwarranted and not supported by the evidence. I urge the members of this committee to standby the recommendations of well respected bodies, such as the AAP and the IDSA. Stop this unprecedented assault on public health, scientists and  physicians."

         "\nTo the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices- ACIP:\n\nMy name is Dr Beth Weitensteiner.  I am a family medicine physician and site medical director in Seattle, Washington.  I strongly urge the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to maintain the recommendation of a universal hepatitis B birth dose in the United States. As a global leader in childhood immunizations, America has a responsibility to uphold science-based policies that protect all infants, children, and adults from preventable diseases like hepatitis B. Universal birth dose vaccination is simple, safe, and highly effective, and it safeguards every baby, regardless of perceived risk or circumstance, and helps close gaps in a fragmented healthcare system.\nEarly administration of the hepatitis B vaccine is perhaps one of the most critical components of this immunization, as age has a direct correlation with the likelihood of developing a chronic infection. Approximately 90% of infants who are exposed to hepatitis B will develop a chronic infection, placing them at a significantly increased risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. In the U.S., before universal childhood vaccination was recommended, an estimated 18,000 children were infected with hepatitis B each year before age 10. Nearly half of these infections were transmitted from mother to child at birth. Many of the remaining 9,000 children had no known exposures to the virus. Now this number is down to almost zero1. As a nation, we cannot afford to go backwards.  \nHepatitis B is endemic to our patient population with most patients getting the disease from vertical transmission from their mother.  One of our patients, a young man 30 years of age, contracted the disease in this manner.   He did not receive childhood vaccines and his Hepatitis B led to Hepatocellular carcinoma.  He died last year in July and left an infant son and young wife.    Simply put the administration of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin and Hepatitis B vaccine at birth followed by two additional vaccines at 4 months and 6 months would have prevented this young man’s death. \n\nWe actively screen all patients for Hepatitis B and provide vaccines to those who qualify based on that screening.  The evidence surrounding the efficacy of the vaccine and prevention of contracting hepatitis based hepatocellular carcinoma is unparalleled.    \nIt is well-documented that the hepatitis B vaccine is extremely safe for newborns. More than four decades of research and surveillance conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shown that most side effects are mild and typical of vaccines, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever.2 Since its introduction in 1986, the vaccine has been administered over one billion times worldwide, providing millions of children with lifelong protection against this dangerous infection.\nMost countries support the universal birth dose and follow the World Health Organization’s (WHO) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to administer the hepatitis B vaccine to all infants within the first 24 hours of birth. Some have suggested that the U.S. should adopt a policy of vaccinating only babies born to infected mothers, as is done in other parts of the world.. Community organizations and health systems in the U.S. currently struggle to identify those living with the disease, which makes disease diagnosis and treatment tougher than disease prevention. The U.S. lacks the public health infrastructure to ensure that all at-risk babies receive the birth dose in a timely manner, making universal vaccination the safest and most effective approach.\nFurthermore, history shows that universal hepatitis B vaccination is the only reliable way to prevent transmission of hepatitis B. Since implementing the birth dose, the U.S. has prevented over 500,000 childhood infections, reduced infant hepatitis B cases by 95%, and prevented an estimated 90,100 childhood deaths.3 Up to 2.4 million people in the U.S. are currently living with hepatitis B, yet roughly 70% remain undiagnosed. This undetected population places babies and children at risk of accidental exposure to this cancer-causing virus.\nWe firmly believe that every parent has the right to make informed decisions for their children. However, those decisions must be guided by clear, objective, and scientifically rigorous recommendations. Eliminating the universal recommendation would create unnecessary barriers and confusion, limiting access to the vaccine and undermining parents’ ability to choose to protect their babies.\nTherefore, I urge the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and all relevant authorities to stand firmly behind science, prevention, and the continued protection of our youngest and most vulnerable citizens by maintaining the universal hepatitis B birth dose.\n\nDr Beth Weitensteiner, DO, FAWM, FAAFP\nInternational Community Health Services\n\n"
